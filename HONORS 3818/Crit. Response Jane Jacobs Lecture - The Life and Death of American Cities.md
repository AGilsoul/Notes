### Thesis
- The great city is in peril
- Great cities need vibrant streets
- If your most precious person (child) is safe to walk home alone, then the city is strong
### The Key: Diversity
- "This ubiquitous principle is the need of cities for a most intricate and close grained diversity of used that give each other constant mutual support, both economically and socially. The components of this diversity can differ enormously, but they must supplement each other in certain concrete ways."
### Robert Moses
- Wanted to put lots of highways through the center of the city basically
- All about efficiency and big moments
- Jane Jacobs does not like him! Started her activism
### Ebenezer Howard
- "To-morro: A Peaceful Path to Social Reform"
- All land (about 1,000 acres) would be owned by a public trust
- Population and development would be staged, until a minimum of 30,000 people were housed
- A greenbelt of 5,000 acres of agricultural land would surround the city
- There would be a mixture of land uses to insure social and economic self-sufficiency
- Thought it was healthier to live with the country, in rural neighborhoods, but in designed ways
- Called these Garden Cities (but more like towns)
- Reflected in modern suburban development, but just owned publicly, not privately, to ensure it is fair for everyone
- The towns would be separated by green space
- This was too planned for Jane Jacobs, she didn't like these at all. No room for diversity!
### World Fair of 1893
- Resulted in a great reverence for grand baroque (sort of fake) buildings that were taken down after they were displayed
- Promoted a grand rebuilding instead of organic growth
### Le Corbusier
- A plan for the city of Paris
- Very modernist
- Would have to tear down all of the old stuff!
- Not sentimental at all for old stuff
- More focused on the efficiency of tall apartment buildings, and many streets are placed underground (the "messiness")
### Purposes of Effective City Planning
- To foster lively and interesting streets
- To make the fabric of these streets as continuous a network as possible throughout a district of potential subcity size and power.
- To use park and squares and public buildings as part of this street fabric; use them to intensify and knit together the fabric's complexity and multiple use. They should not be used to island off different uses from each other, or to island off subdistrict neighborhoods.
- To emphasize the functional identity of areas large enough to work as districts.
### Sidewalks
- "If we are to maintain a city society that can diagnose and keep abreast of deeper social problems, the starting point must be, in any case, to strengthen whatever workable forces for maintaining safety and civilization do exist in the cities we do have."
- It is kept primarily by an intricate almost unconscious, network of voluntary controls and standards among the people themselves, and enforced by the people themselves
### The Uses of Sidewalks: Safety
- "We are lucky possessors of a city order that makes it relatively simple to keep the peace because there are plenty of eyes on the street. But there is nothing simple about that order itself, or the bewildering number of component that go into it."
### The Uses of Sidewalks: Contact
- The social life of city sidewalks is precisely that they are public
- There is a felling for the public identify of people, a web of public respect and trust
- The absence of this trust is a disaster to the city street. Its cultivation cannot be institutionalized, and above all it ..."
- The casual public sidewalk life of cities ties directly into other types of public life
### The Uses of Sidewalks: Assimilating Children
- Among the superstitions of planning and housing is a fantasy about the transformation of children - condemned to play on city streets
- Sinister moral environments
- The key is simplicity itself (what does she mean by this?)
- The real problem is unsupervised city streets
- Children in cities need a variety of places in which to play and learn
- They need, among other things, opportunities for all kinds of sports and exercise and physical skills
### The Uses of City Neighborhoods
- "A successful city neighborhood is a place that keeps sufficiently abreast of its problems so it is not destroyed by them. An unsuccessful neighborhood is a place that is overwhelmed by its defects and problems and is progressively more helpless before them. Our cities contain all degrees of success and failure. But on the whole we Americans are poor at handling city neighborhoods."
### So What Makes a Neighborhood Good?
- Not one particular social class
- It is socially and economically useful to the city itself
- Has successful localized self government
- Good at both informal and formal self management of society
- Relates effectively to other neighborhood, districts, or the larger environment
- Natural cross connections
- Provides opportunities for mobility
- Fluidity of use and choice
### Three Kinds of Neighborhoods
- The city as a whole
- The street neighborhood
- The district
- They supplement each other in complex ways
- The city is marked by wholeness, bringing people together with communities of interests
