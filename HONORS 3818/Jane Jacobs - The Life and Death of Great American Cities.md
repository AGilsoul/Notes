### Planning Theory
Lots of projects in cities that aim to fix problems oftentimes exacerbate these situations
- Low-income housing projects that become worse than the places they were supposed to replace
- Middle-income housing areas that are dull and have no life to them
- Poor commercial centers and cultural centers that "are unable to support a good bookstore"
- Big roads that split up great cities
People and business are displaced so these projects can take place with little compensation

Even though, in theory, places should be thriving, they often don't, planning theory doesn't seem to work in big cities
- Morningside Heights is an example, houses Columbia, Juilliard, hospitals and churches, with middle and upper class housing
- Attempting to combat this with more planning theory, with caused more decay
- At the same time, places in cities with no planning theory can do very well

Cities should be viewed as a big trial and error project, learning from mistakes. However many ignore the past successes and failures, and instead try to take from suburbs, towns, and imaginary cities, but not real cities!

We have been convinced that this sort of stuff is good for us.
### Cars
Cars are often said to be the villains and the cause of our cities being bad, but the true villain is incompetent city planning. People don't know how to plan cities with cars in mind without taking away from the city.
- The needs of cars are simpler and less complex than those of cities. Solving car problems does not solve city problems, but many planners work with the idea that it does
- Traffic is a symptom of how the city itself works. A better understanding of the city can guide what to do with the streets, and what the streets need.
### Outer Appearance
Though we have a fantasy of how things should work and what should be good, this is often not reflected in reality, but when these two collide in city planning, reality is pushed aside.
- For example, North End in Boston.
	- Viewed as the worst slum in Boston (on paper)
	- Wedged against industry, but still has working places and commerce mixed in with the residences
	- High concentration of dwellings
	- Planning would say it is a bad place
	- However, despite this, it has a friendly atmosphere with kids playing and people walking and talking, and repaired buildings
	- Despite this, bankers won't give them loans because of the fact that they "have gotten their theories from the same intellectual sources as the planners"
	- More superstitious than anything
- City planning has become a pseudoscience, more influenced by art, oversimplification, superstitions, and wishful thinking
- It is useless to plan a city just based on how you want it to look without considering its functions
- For example, Harlem in New York
	- There is a housing project with a rectangular grass lawn
	- The tenants hate the lawn
	- One tenant said "Nobody cared what we wanted when they built this place. They threw our houses down and pushed us here and pushed our friends somewhere else. We don't have a place around here to get a cup of coffee or a newspaper even, or borrow fifty cents. Nobody cared what we need. But the big men come and a look at that grass and say, 'Isn't it wonderful! Now the poor have everything!'"
	- The planners only considered how they wanted this area to look, not how the people living there would feel about it
	- It is an illusion of order, and ignores reality
### Origins of Planning
Started more or less with Ebenezer Howard
- English court reporter in late 19th century London
- Didn't like the living conditions of the poor
- Proposed to halt the growth of the city, and start building new towns in the countryside - Garden Cities - where the poor can live closer to nature
- Self-sufficient small towns
- These towns didn't take into account that people might want autonomy, however. Only were nice "if you were docile and had no plans of your own and did not mind spending your life among other with no plans of their own"
- Plans of significance only belonged to those in charge ("As in all Utopias")
- Surrounded by a Green Belt of agriculture for industry
- The town and Green Belt would be controlled under the public authority, and have a maximum population
- This planning was not only a new physical environment and social life, but a new political and economic society
- While city planners don't try to make Garden Cities, they still use the underlying principles all the time
- These principles are destructive, because they take the various uses of cities and separate them, instead of making them work together
- These principles work under the belief that cities will be static and unchanging, which is simply untrue as they are very dynamic

Decentrists adopted these ideas.
- Wanted to decentralize great cities, disperse them into smaller towns and separated cities
- Thought that lots of people could only be a necessary evil, but that there should at least be an illusion of isolation
- Thought planned communities should be self-contained, isolated, static, and controlled by the planners from the start
- Interested in only city failures, not city successes
- None of their ideas attempted to understand cities, only getting rid of them

Le Corbusier had an idea for his own social Utopia
- The Radiant City
- Skyscrapers in a park
- 1,200 inhabitants per acre, but this was not crowded due to the high skyscrapers
- 95% of the ground would remain open
- "Vertical Garden City"
- Decentrists didn't like this
- This concept had great impact on cities
- Attempted to make car planning a big part of the scheme (at the time an exciting idea)
- Proposed underground roads to keep pedestrians off the streets and in the parks
- This city had simplicity and harmony
- Visually appealing, but again tells nothing of how the city works

Most city planners nowadays combine the ideas of the Decentrists and Le Corbusier
- Use selective removal to see how many old buildings can be left up while still making the area appear as a Radiant Garden City

City Beautiful at Chicago Columbian Exposition
- Aim was the City Monumental
- Cities with a civic center or cultural center arranged along a boulevard, along a mall, bordered by a park, or interspersed with a park. Sorted out from the rest of city for grand effect
- People were proud of these monuments, however the rest of the city around them would get run down rather than uplifted
- When the fair became a part of the city, nobody came to the fair
### Diversity
Cities need diverse uses that mutually support one another, socially and economically
Diversity stimulates diversity
- Unsuccessful city areas lack this mutual support
- City planning needs to take into account these diverse working relationships to be successful
- Cities deal with the combinations of their various parts and uses, not the separate pieces themselves
- Big cities naturally generate diversity, they house a number of different types of businesses and people
- The larger a city, the greater variety it has in manufacturing, and a greater number of small manufacturers because big manufacturers don't need to be in big cities to survive, unlike small ones
- Small manufacturers are more dependent on a number of other small manufacturers, and thus stimulate more diversity (diversity makes more diversity)
- For small offices, to keep workers, they need to be somewhere where the workers can have their other needs met easily (i.e. a city)
- Cities benefit smallness, for example, because of the higher density who would support smaller more niche businesses, like delicatessens, foreign groceries, etc. 
- In urbanization, the big get bigger, but the smaller get more numerous
- Great variety means a high proportion of small elements
- This is not always the case though, for example, the Bronx lacks diversity and vitality
- Even entire cities can suffer from this, like Detroit
### Four Conditions for Diversity
1. The area must serve multiple primary functions (ideally more than two)
	- Ensures that there will be people on different schedules in the area for different purposes, but can use the same facilities
2. Most blocks in the area must be short
	- Frequent opportunities to turn corners and change streets
3. Buildings in the area must have a variety of ages and conditions, that vary in economic yield
	- These various buildings must be close together
4. There must be a dense population of people
	- This can include lots of people who are there because they live there
These four conditions are very important! They create effective economic pools of use. Different cities have different potentials for diversity, but with these conditions at play, they can maximize it.
### Sidewalks
Children
- Lots of ideas on planning revolve around the development of children
- Children in a daycare who were from nice housing projects would have to go home to the same playgrounds would deal with the same bullies
- Those who came from "slum" streets could choose from any street, and chose the safest ones, and if they did get picked on, there was people they knew would protect them
- Street gangs have most fights in parks, not on streets
- Those children who get involved, are from places where they can't play on the streets
- Playing on the streets, you can't get away with as much because there are more adults there
- Playgrounds and parks are often more violent than the streets
- In the North End, the low delinquency rate can be attributed the good surveillance of children at play where the "community is at its strongest - on the sidewalks"
- Sheltered parks to combat this issue become boring for children
- Children in cities need different places to play and learn, and an "unspecialized outdoor home base"
- Generalized areas, such as playgrounds and parks, don't provide diverse activities and exercise
- Sidewalks are easily supervised by adults while they are doing other activities
- Spaces and equipment don't rear children, people do
- **The idea that playgrounds and supervisors are good for children, and streets and regular people are bad for children, comes from a contempt for regular people**
- People need to take a small amount of public responsibility for each other, and this is a lesson that is learned through the experience of strangers taking a small amount of public responsibility for you
- Even though most city planners are men, they build communities almost like they are designing a matriarchal society
- By separating working places and commerce places from residences, also separates men from the women and children, but the children need both, and this is easily accomplished on good sidewalks
- To children, roaming city sidewalks is much more interesting than a playground or backyard, **same as adults!**
- Sidewalks are very convenient for children
- The nature of many activities for children is not to plan them ahead of time and make a big deal out of them, but to just do them when you feel like it, which sidewalks allow
- You can't plan for play on sidewalks unless the sidewalks will be used for a wide variety of purposes
	- Must be sufficiently wide
	- Narrower sidewalks bring more sedentary play, and more play in the actual road
	- Even when sidewalks don't have enough space, children still like the convenience and interest of the streets
