### City as Text
- The built environment, or material landscape, gives meaning to places
- Urban landscapes reflect contemporaneous trends
- They reflect zeitgeist, or the spirit of the times
- The historical development of a city is embedded in its built environment
- We can "read" the signs and symbols it evokes as a sort of urban biography
### Great Cities
- Kevin Lynch suggests that some cities are "legible"
	- Elements of vocabulary of design that we can read.
- Great cities are legible, understandable, and therefore comfortable, secure and interesting places to be in, the alternative to chaos or tedium
### Legibility
- The ease with which the parts of a city can be recognized and can be organized into a coherent pattern
- It can be visually grasped as a related pattern of recognizable symbols
- A legible city is one whose district or landmarks or pathways are easily identifiable and are easily grouped into an over-all pattern
### Issues
- Perception: Not just as a thing itself, but how it is perceived by its inhabitants
- Context: Nothing in the city is experienced by itself, but always in relation to its surroundings, the sequences of events leading up to it, and the memory of paste experiences
- Emotional well-being: The need to recognized and pattern our surroundings is so crucial and has such long roots in the past, that this image has wide practical and emotional importance to the individual
- Rootedness in place: A good environment image gives its possessor an important sense of emotional scrutiny 
### Image Coherence
- Public images are those common mental pictures carried by large numbers of a citys inhabitants: areas of agreement which might be expected to appear in the interaction of a single physical reality, a common culture, and a basic physiological nature
- The world may be organized around  set of focal points, or be broken into named regions, or be linked by remembered routes. Other physical elements that lead to coherence might be street systems, distinctive materials of construction and so forth
### Identity
- The meaning of individuality or oneness
- What patterns do you see?
- What does this tell us about the structure of the city?
