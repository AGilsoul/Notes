- Every city has an image, that is the overlap of many unique individual images
Five Elements encompass the contents of city images
- Paths
- Edges
- Districts
- Nodes
- Landmarks
### Paths
- Channels along with observers move
- Streets, walkways, transit lines, canals, railroads
- Predominant elements in many people's image
### Edges
- Linear elements not used/considered as paths by observers
- Boundaries between two phases
- Shores, railroad cuts, edges of development, walls
- Useful for outlining in an image
### Districts
- 2-Dimensional sections of the city which the observer can enter inside of
- Have some common identifying character
- Identifiable from the inside
- Used for exterior reference if visible from the outside
- Cities typically structured in this way
### Nodes
- Strategic spots in the city that observers can enter, and are the "intensive foci to and from which he is traveling"
- Junctions, places of break in transportation, crossing/convergence of paths, moments of shift from one structure to another, or even just concentrations such as a street corner hangout or enclosed square
- Can be the focus/epitome of a district, can be called cores
- Related to paths, since it can be the convergence of paths
- Some of theses are found in almost every image, and can be a dominant feature
### Landmarks
- Point of reference, but observers don't enter these, they are external
- Usually simply defined physical objects
- Building, sign, store, or mountain
- Can symbolize a constant direction (isolated towers, golden domes, great hills), but even slow moving mobile points like the Sun can be used for this
- Other landmarks can just be local, visible only in certain areas looking from a certain direction
- Signs, store fronts, trees, and doorknobs
- Clues of identity and structure, relied upon more as the journey becomes more familiar

- The image of a given area can shift with different viewing circumstances
	- Expressways could be a path for the driver, but an edge for the pedestrian
	- Central area can be a district if the city is organized on a medium scale, or a node when considering the larger metropolitan area
- Categories have stability when the viewer maintains the same perspective
- None of the above elements exist in isolation
	- Districts structured with nodes, defined by edges, crossed by paths and covered in landmarks
### Paths (Importance)
- For most people, paths are the predominant city element, but important varies according to how familiar one is with the city
	- For example, Boston
	- People who weren't familiar with it imagined it in broad generalized characteristics
	- Those who know the city better thought more in terms of the different paths and the relationships between them, and they relied more upon small landmarks, less on regions or paths
- Obstacles to traffic raise the importance of surrounding elements, such as the Palisades in Jersey City focusing attention on the streets that surmount it
- Special use or activity along a street may define it for certain observers
- Characteristic spatial qualities can strengthen the image of certain paths, such as extremely wide or narrow streets, can derive part of their importance
	- People automatically trust the "main" (wide streets)
	- The opposite can also be true
- Building facades that line the streets can also help shape their identity
	- Beacon Street, Commonwealth Avenue
- Planting is usually unimportant, but a lot of it can reinforce a path image
- Proximity to special features in a city also makes a path more important, here the path acts as an edge as well
	- Atlantic Avenue derives much importance from relation to wharves and the harbor
	- Storrow Drive along Charles River
	- Cambridge Street's border relationship to Beacon Hill
- Visual exposure of the path from other parts of the city can help importance too
	- Bridges over the Charles River
- Importance can be derived from structural reasons too
	- Massachusetts Avenue is intersected by many confusing streets, making it a major Boston element
- If major paths lack identity or are confused with one another, the entire city image can be troubled
- Continuity along a path is important too (material wise?)
	- Change in the buildings that line the path can interrupt continuity
	- Changing the name of a path hurts
- Paths can have different qualities depending on the direction as well
	- Can be done with a gradient, where one quality changes as you go one way down the path
		- Topography
		- Use intensity
		- Age
		- Curves in the path
- Paths with well known and clear origins have a stronger identity and help tie the city together
	- This end-from-end differentiation be be created by other elements near the end/apparent end of a path
- A few important paths may be imaged together as a single structure as long as they have a consistent general relationship to one another, such as the Boston subway system, or the Los Angeles freeway system
- One-way restrictions and irreversibility complicate the city image
- Differentiated character in major streets helps people visualize them
### Edges
- Linear elements
