### Curves
Function Formulation of Curves
- $x, y$ are points on the curve
- $y=f(x)$, relationship between points on the curve
- $y=ax+c$, straight line
- Can't make curves that fail the vertical line test
Implicit Representation of Curves
- $f(x,y) = 0$
- $y=ax+c \implies 0=ax+by+c$, implicit line
- $x^2+y^2-r^2=0$, circle of radius $r$ centered at origin
	- $(x-c_x)^2+(y-c_y)^2-r^2=0$, circle of radius $r$ centered at $(c_x, c_y)$
Implicit Vector Representation of Curves
- $f(\textbf{x})=0$, $x=\begin{bmatrix}x\\y\end{bmatrix}$
Parametric Vector Representation of Curves
- $\textbf{x}=\textbf{f}(t)$, $t$ is our parameter
- Draw from $\textbf{f}(0)$ to $\textbf{f}(1)$ (or whatever our endpoints for $t$ are)
- Directly gives us solution of implicit representation
- Reparameterization keeps the curve, but changes which $t$ values give which value
- Adds another dimension in a sense
### Straight Line
- $x-2y+2=0$, implicit
- $x=2t, y=t+1\implies \textbf{x}=\begin{bmatrix}2t\\t+1\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}2\\1\end{bmatrix}t+\begin{bmatrix}0\\1\end{bmatrix}$, parametric
- In general, $\textbf{f}(t)=(\textbf{p}_1-\textbf{p}_0)t+\textbf{p}_0$, given two points on the line $\textbf{p}_0,\textbf{p}_1$
	- Point on line $\textbf{p}_0$ and direction $\textbf{p}_1-\textbf{p}_0$
- Even more general, $\textbf{f}(t)=\textbf{a}t+\textbf{b}$
- Can think of as linear interpolation between $\textbf{p}_0$ and $\textbf{p}_1$
	- $\textbf{f}(t)=(1-t)\textbf{p}_0+t\textbf{p}_1$, this is the same equation!
### Bezier Curves
Most popular curve formulation in computer graphics
- $\textbf{f}(t)=\textbf{a}t^2+\textbf{b}t+\textbf{c}$, gives an actual curvy curve
- Not very intuitive! What values for $\textbf{a,b,c}$?
Trick!
- Set t=0 at one end, t=1 at another
- Look at tangent to curve at two end points, they will intersect at some point!
- Name endpoint at t=0 $\textbf{p}_0$, intersection $\textbf{p}_1$, t=1 $\textbf{p}_2$, these are the control points
- Now, we have $\textbf{f}(t)=(\textbf{p}_0-2\textbf{p}_1+\textbf{p}_2)t^2+2(\textbf{p}_1-\textbf{p}_0)t+\textbf{p}_0$
- Better, $\textbf{f}(t)=(1-t)^2\textbf{p}_0+2(1-t)t\textbf{p}_1+t^2\textbf{p}_2$
	- Sorta second degree interpolation
	- Each point only appears once!
	- This is a quadratic Bezier curve!
- Can add another control point for a cubic Bezier curve
- Cubic, $\textbf{f}(t)=(1-t)^3\textbf{p}_0+3(1-t)^2t\textbf{p}_1+3(1-t)t^2\textbf{p}_2+t^3\textbf{p}_3$
- Quadratic Bezier curves are planar curves (3 points in space define a plane)
- Cubic Bezier curves don't have to be on the same plane (can be a 3D curve!)
- So cubic Bezier curves are the most common\
- (Notice Pascal's Triangle in terms below)
Linear Interpolation (first degree Bezier curve):
- $\textbf{f}(t)=(1-t)\textbf{p}_0+t\textbf{p}_1$
Quadratic Bezier Curve:
- $\textbf{f}(t)=(1-t)^2\textbf{p}_0+2(1-t)t\textbf{p}_1+t^2\textbf{p}_2$
Cubic Bezier Curve:
- $\textbf{f}(t)=(1-t)^3\textbf{p}_0+3(1-t)^2t\textbf{p}_1+3(1-t)t^2\textbf{p}_2+t^3\textbf{p}_3$

- We can't make circles with these, because they are polynomials, but we can approximate them really closely
### Bezier Curve Properties
- Interpolate the first and the last control points (intermediate points determine shape)
- Remains inside the convex hull of the control points
	- Convex hull is the convex polygon containing all of the control points (in whatever order of points makes the convex hull)
	- Very useful, gives us an idea of where the curve is
- Affine invariant
	- If we take the curve, and apply some affine transformation (translation, rotation, scale), that resultant curve is the exact same as if we applied the same transformation to the control points, and then made the curve
### Derivatives
- $y=f(x), f'(x)=\frac{df}{dx}$, gives us slope of a curve at a point (scalar value)
- In parametric, $\textbf{f}(t), \textbf{f}'(t)=\frac{d\textbf{f}(t)}{dt}$, gives us the tangent vector (direction of tangent line)
### Derivatives of Bezier Curves
- Cubic Bezier curve: $\textbf{f}(t)=(1-t)^3\textbf{p}_0+3(1-t)^2t\textbf{p}_1+3(1-t)t^2\textbf{p}_2+t^3\textbf{p}_3$
- $\textbf{f}'(t)=(1-t)t^23(\textbf{p}_1-\textbf{p}_0)+2(1-t)^2t3(\textbf{p}_2-\textbf{p}_1)+t^23(\textbf{p}_3-\textbf{p}_2)$ gives us a quadratic Bezier curve, but this represents directions of the above curve, not positions
- $\textbf{f}''(t)=(1-t)6(\textbf{p}_0-2\textbf{p}_1+\textbf{p}_2)+t6(\textbf{p}_1-2\textbf{p}_2+\textbf{p}_3)$, gives us a first degree Bezier curve
### de Casteljau's Algorithm
- Algorithm for drawing Bezier curves
- Draw line segments between control points (outside edges of convex hull except between endpoints)
- Split these lines by t and (1-t) for some value of t
- Draw lines between the split points
- For every line that is t + (1-t) in length still, split it again until you can't and you will bet a point on the curve that is the value of t
- ![[Pasted image 20240915165855.png]]
- The point on the curve, and the four points before it also act as control points defining that part of the curve!
- The point and the other three points define the rest of the curve
- We can split Bezier curves and find the new control points this way
### Piecewise Polynomial Curves
- Long curves need lots of control points
- This means with Bezier curves we need higher and higher degree polynomial curves
- We can stitch cubic Bezier curves together!
- We must ensure the curve is $C^0$ continuous (regular continuity)
- We need $C^1$ continuity (derivative vectors match at joining point)
- We might only want $G^1$ continuity (direction of derivative vector matches, not necessarily magnitude at joining point)
	- Can reparametrize to get $C^1$ continuity
	- $C^1 \implies G^1$
- $C^2$ continuity means the change of the direction is continuous (curvature continuity)
- $G^2$ continuity means the direction of the second derivative vector is the same, but not necessarily magnitude at joining point (also a kind of curvature continuity)
- We don't really care about higher degrees of continuity, they aren't that noticable
- ![[Pasted image 20240915171742.png]]
- Can define piecewise polynomial curves other ways!
### Polynomial Curves
- $\textbf{f}(t)=\textbf{a}t^2+\textbf{b}t+\textbf{c}$, $t=s^2$
- $\textbf{f}(s)=\textbf{a}s^4+\textbf{b}s^2+c$, same curve even though a higher order polynomial with reparameterization
- Only thing that changed is how fast the parameter moves along the curve, the shape is the same
- We don't usually reparametrize like this, but like this
-  $\textbf{f}(t)=\textbf{a}t^2+\textbf{b}t+\textbf{c}$, $t=s+1$
-  $\textbf{f}(s)=\textbf{a}(s+1)^2+\textbf{b}(s+1)+\textbf{c}$
- $\textbf{f}(t)=\textbf{f}(g(s))$, $t=g(s)$
### Parameterization
- Curve can be defined by a number of control points that is goes through $\textbf{p}_0,...,\textbf{p}_n$
- Can also define values of parameter $t$ that we expect at each point $t_0,...,t_n$
- $\textbf{C}(t), t_0\leq t\leq t_n$
### Generalizing Bezier Curves
- $\textbf{f}(t)=(1-t)^3\textbf{p}_0+3(1-t)^2t\textbf{p}_1+3(1-t)t^2\textbf{p}_2+t^3\textbf{p}_3$\$
- General form
- $\textbf{f}(t)=a_0(t)\textbf{p}_0+a_1(t)\textbf{p}_1+a_2(t)\textbf{p}_2+a_3(t)\textbf{p}_3$
- How we define the weights $a_n(t)$ changes the curve, can be Bezier or not
- General Curve:
- $\textbf{f}(t)=\sum_ia_i(t)\textbf{p}_i$, but $\sum_ia_i(t)=1$ must be true
- If they don't sum to 1, the curve will not be affine invariant!
	- We get a hidden control point of 0!
### B-Splines
- $\textbf{f}(t)=\sum_iN_{i,n}(t)\textbf{p}_i$
- $\sum_iN_{i,n}(t)=1$
- n is the order of the curve
- These don't actually interpolate the first and last control points
	- Can make the splines converge to the first and last points by repeating them in the curve formulation
- Can make $C^2$ curves with cubic polynomials
- Can be converted to Bezier curves
### Rational Curves
- $\textbf{f}(t)=\frac{\sum_ia_i(t)\textbf{p}_i}{\sum_ia_i(t)}=\sum_i\frac{a_i(t)}{\sum_ja_j(t)}\textbf{p}_i=\sum_ia^*_i(t)\textbf{p}_i$, makes the weights equal one if they don't!
### Rational Bezier Curves
- $\textbf{f}(t)=\frac{\sum_ib_{i,n}(t)w_i\textbf{p}_i}{\sum_ib_{i,n}(t)w_i}$
- Each control point now has another weight parameter $w_i$, so the user can specify the weights!
- $\textbf{f}(t)=\frac{(1-t)^2w_0\textbf{p}_0+2(1-t)tw_1\textbf{p}_1+t^2w_2\textbf{p}_2}{(1-t)^2w_0+2(1-t)tw_1+t^2w_2}$
- Typically $w_0=w_2=1$, we only mess with the middle weight
- $\textbf{f}(t)=\frac{(1-t)^2\textbf{p}_0+2(1-t)tw_1\textbf{p}_1+t^2\textbf{p}_2}{(1-t)^2+2(1-t)tw_1+t^2}$
- The higher the middle weight, the more the curve is pulled towards the middle point, and vice versa
- $w_1>1$ gives hyperbolas, $w_1=1$ gives parabolas, $w_1<1$ gives conics, like ellipses and circles
- This means we can represent circles with rational Bezier curves
### Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines
- $\textbf{f}(t)=\frac{\sum_iN_{i,n}(t)w_i\textbf{p}_i}{\sum_iN_{i,n}(t)w_i}$, each weight determines how much the curve is pulled towards the control point
- Called NURBS
- Very commonly used
- Useful for modeling 3D surfaces
	- Create a curve in one direction, another in the perpendicular direction, and take the tensor product between the two
	- Control polygon isn't interpolated with these surfaces
### Approximating Curves
- Don't necessarily go through the control points
- We can't force them to go through each control point without breaking nice properties, such as continuity, just the first and last control points
- This is sometimes not acceptable
### Interpolating Curves
- Curves that hit all control points, and so they are called data points
### Catmull-Rom Curves
- Each curve segment, defined by four control points, interpolates the middle two control points, but not the first and the last. To get them, we can do the same trick with repeating them to get them interpolated
- Cubic Catmull-Rom curve segments are defined by four control points, and makes a cubic polynomial, so it can be converted into a Bezier curve with different control points (first and last of Bezier curve are the middle two interpolated points from the Catmull-Rom curve)
- ![[Pasted image 20240918170321.png]]
- At $t=t_1$ the curve will be at $\textbf{p}_1$, etc.
- Parametrization is important here
	- Uniform ($t_0,...,t_n$ evenly spaced)
		- Gives self intersections with control points too close to each other
	- Chordal (spaced based on distance between control points)
		- Curve too far from control polygon! Can also unintentionally self-intersect
	- Centripetal (spaced based on distance between square root of distance between control points)
		- Provably the best way to do it! Very close to control polygon, impossible to self-intersect when not wanted
- Very popular interpolated curve formulation!
### A Class of $C^2$ Interpolating Curves
- Not polynomials, but have nice properties
- Interpolating function and a blending function
- Interpolation function $\textbf{F}_i$:
	- Interpolates three consecutive control points 
	- $\textbf{F}_i(0)=\textbf{p}_0,\textbf{F}_i(\frac{\pi}{2})=\textbf{p}_1,\textbf{F}_i(\pi)=\textbf{p}_2$
- Blending function
	- Blends successive interpolation functions together
	- $\textbf{C}_i(\theta)=\cos^2\theta\textbf{F}_i(\theta+\frac{\pi}{2})+\sin^2\theta\textbf{F}_{i+1}(\theta)$
	- Because of sin and cos, first and second derivatives are always dependent on just one interpolating function, and so if our interpolation function is $C^2$ continuous, then the entire curve is $C^2$ continuous
- Example Interpolation Functions:
	- Bezier
	- Circular
	- Elliptical
	- Hybrid (Circular-Elliptical)
