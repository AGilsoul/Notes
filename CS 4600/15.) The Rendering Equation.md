### Surface Reflections
- The shinier something looks, the smoother we assume it is
- If we zoom in on a surface that is not shiny at all, we would assume that it would be bumpy!
- This means if we assume light just bounces off the surface perfectly, then the reflections would be scattered, and so it doesn't matter what direction we look at it from, we see the same reflection no matter the angle
