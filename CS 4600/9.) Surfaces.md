### Implicit Surfaces
- $f(\textbf{x})=0$ 
- $\textbf{x}=\begin{bmatrix}x\\y\\z\end{bmatrix}$
- Sphere: 
	- $f(\textbf{x})=x^2+y^2+z^2-r^2=0$
	- $f(\textbf{x})=\textbf{x}\cdot\textbf{x}-r^2=0$
- Infinite Plane:
	- $f(\textbf{x})=z=0$
	- $f(\textbf{x})=\textbf{x}\cdot\textbf{n}-c=0$, $\textbf{n}$ is unit vector normal to plane
### Bezier Patches
- Cubic Bezier curve defined by four control points in space
- Can build a surface with these curves
- Need four cubic Bezier curves and use weighted average of these four curves
- This gives the surface
- One parameter says where you are along the curve, the other where you are between the curves
- Can also have NURBS Surfaces, similar thing
### Polygonal Meshes
- Most popular method today
- Composed of polygons made of vertices and edges
- List of vertices
	- $x,y,z$ position per vertex
- List of polygons (faces)
	- Vertex indices
	- Edge indices?
- List of edges? (implicit from the previous two, but convenient to store)
- Winged Edge
	- 2 vertex indices
	- 1 or 2 face indices
- Half Edge
	- 1 vertex index
	- 1 face index
- Polygonal meshes are popular because of the direct control they give over the overall surface
- We have lots of tools to make polygonal meshes, but it is still hard to make detailed meshes
### Subdivision
- Low-resolution to high-resolution mesh
### Catmull-Clark Subdivision
- Most common subdivision method
- From UofU!
- For each face, split it into multiple faces (tessellation)
- Generate vertex at center the face, then vertices at the center of each edge, connect them, then move them towards the average of the neighboring faces
- Can make a limit surface that is $C^2$ continuous
	- For vertices with four edges, they can become perfectly smooth on the limit
	- For vertices with another amount of edges, they can become smooth but not as smooth
- Works best with quads (polygons with four sides)
### Triangular Meshes
- Most polygonal meshes are converted to triangular meshes for rendering, since triangles must be planar!
- Easy to do with quads, but two ways of doing it! User's preference
- Can convert basically any mesh to a triangular mesh
