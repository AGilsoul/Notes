### Vector Images
SVG is the most popular vector image format
- Similar to an XML file
- Uses vectors to define points that define polygons and such on an image
### Raster Images
- Formed by pixels, typically in scan line order (left->right, top->bottom)
- Each pixel has a color associated with it

Color
- Light on the visible spectrum
- Light is a collection of lots of wavelengths
- Different cones in our eyes sensitive to different wavelengths of light (Red, Green, Blue)
- Because we have sensitivity to these three different wavelengths, we define colors in pixels using red green and blue
- RGB values in [0, 1]
	- black        = (0,0,0)
	- red           = (1,0,0)
	- green       = (0,1,0)
	- blue         = (0,0,1)
	- yellow      = (1,1,0)
	- magenta  = (1,0,1)
	- cyan        =  (0,1,1)
	- white       =  (1,1,1)
- Forms 3D coordinate system
- [0, 1] in monitors is called Low Dynamic Range (LDR)
- Brighter lights than what is white in RGB is in the High Dynamic Range (HDR)
- LDR Storage:
	- 8 bits / color channel (0 to 255) ***most common*** (if done right, can be sufficient, and basically no difference to 16-bits)
	- 16 bits / color channel (0 to 65535)
- HDR Storage
	- 16-bit float (half)
	- 32-bit float ***for our computations, we will use this, and convert to LDR*** 
### Raster Image Storage
- Interleaved Storage
	RGB RGB RGB RGB RGB RGB
	RGB RGB RGB RGB RGB RGB
	RGB RGB RGB RGB RGB RGB
	- Pixel by pixel
	- If you know just image width, then you can store this as a 1D array with scan line order
	- Better compression
	- Most common
- Separate Channels
	RRRRRR GGGGGG BBBBBB
	RRRRRR GGGGGG BBBBBB
	RRRRRR GGGGGG BBBBBB
	- If you want to modify specific channels only
	- Useful in some applications
	- Less common
### Popular Raster Image Formats
LDR
- BMP: Bitmap Image File
- PPM: Portable Pixmap Image File
	- Uncompressed
	- LDR
	- 1/8/16 bits per channel
	- really simple
- PNG: Portable Graphics Format
	- Lossless compression
	- LDR
	- 8/16 bits per channel
		or
	- Color table (2 to 256 colors, but you lose stuff in compression when quantizing colors to fit in color table if you have more than 256 colors, generated specifically for each image)
		- Each pixel stores just an index to its color in the color table
		- Very efficient if you have lots of pixels and not very many colors
- GIF: Graphics Interchange Format
	- Lossless Compression
	- LDR 
	- Color table (2 to 256 colors)
- JPEG: Joint Photographic Experts Group
	- Lossy compression (can't be uncompressed in a way that exactly reproduces the original)
		- Allows images to be compressed significantly more than the uncompressed image
	- LDR
	- Equivalent of 8 bits per channel
- Animated GIF
	- Stores lots of different images
	- Supported basically everywhere
- Animated PNG
	- Not as widely supported
HDR
- EXR: OpenEXR (by ILM)
	- Lossy/lossless compression
	- HDR
	- 16/32 bits per channel
	- Film production
### Image Compression
On clip art image of red and white teapot
- BMP:
	- 146 KB
	- Looks identical
- Lossless PNG
	- Example - 5 KB
	- Looks Identical
- JPEG Quality: 0
	- Example - 17 KB
	- Looks really bad
	- Takes 8x8 blocks of pixels and stores average of block, then stores difference from average for each pixel. Differences can be encoded with very few bits, hence the compression
- JPEG Quality: 5
	- Example - 20 KB
	- Looks a little better
- JPEG Quality: 10
	- Example - 26 KB
	- Looks pretty good, still some artifacts on sharp edges
-  GIF 16 colors
	- Example - 3 KB
	- Looks fine, and works because the image is simple
	- Original contains 48 colors, because of colors in between white and red, quantized to 16 colors
	- Basically no difference
	
On an actual photograph
- Lossless PNG -> JPEG Quality: 0
	- Example - 41 KB -> 11 KB
	- Looks pretty bad
- Lossless PNG -> JPEG Quallity 5:
	- Example - 41 KB -> 15 KB
	- Looks a little better
- Lossless PNG -> JPEG Quality 10:
	- Example - 41 KB -> 22 KB
	- Looks almost identical

	**JPEG shouldn't be used on simple images, lower quality and more storage, instead use it on larger images with lots of different colors**

- Depending on the image, you should use different compression algorithms
- Lots of compression algorithms that use color tables will store a color value based on the neighboring pixels' colors
- Example, color in image is equally close to two different color values in the table
	- If you always choose the brighter one, the whole image will be brighter, and vice versa
	- Keeps average error in neighborhood as small as possible
	- As a result, if you have a region of in between pixels that are the same color, they will switch back and forth between the lighter and darker colors to keep the average error small
	- At a glance, hard to tell the difference and you just see the average color (the original)
### Raster Image in Memory
- Interleaved
	RGB RGB RGB RGB RGB RGB
	RGB RGB RGB RGB RGB RGB
	RGB RGB RGB RGB RGB RGB
- Scanline order
	- Row by row
- Swizzled order
	- Goes over images in local regions
	- Z-curve example
		![[Pasted image 20240825003802.png]]
	- Other ways to swizzle too
- For image manipulation, images are uncompressed in memory
- GPUs use image compression algorithms however

### Displays and Cameras
Gamma $\gamma$
- We are better at differentiating between dark colors than bright colors
- For example, 1 and 2 are 1 apart, but 2 is twice as much as 1. 100 and 101 are also 1 apart, but the percent difference is much smaller
- More discrete color intensity values are allocated for lower intensities than brighter intensities because of this
- Gamma determines this!![[Pasted image 20240827162141.png]]
- $\textbf{c}_{out}=\textbf{c}_{in}^{\gamma}=\textbf{c}_{desired}^{1/\gamma}$
- $\textbf{c}_{out}=\textbf{c}_{desired}$
- You must gamma correct your desired value (raise it to $1/\gamma$), to get the correct output
- sRGB: $\gamma \approx 2.2$, not exactly because the function used by sRGB is not exactly exponential (but very close)

Displays
- Each pixel contains 3 LEDs (subpixels) for each color (RGB)
Cameras
- Each pixel senses light instead, but instead of side by side LEDs, each pixel captures only one of the 3 colors
- Inbetween values are interpolated
- For each 2x2 square, there is 1 red pixel, 2 green pixels, and 1 blue pixel (more for green because that is in the middle of our range)

Raster Images
- "A pixel is not a little square!"
- Think of a pixel as a color at a single point, not a whole square
- Images are 2D signals, and each pixel is a discrete value on the signal

### Alpha Blending
Alpha $\alpha$
- Opacity
- Fully transparent: $\alpha=0$
- Fully opaque: $\alpha=1$

For each pixel:
- Color and alpha
	- RGBA
- 8-bits per channel -> 32 bits (convenient value)

Raster Image Storage
- Interleaved Storage
	RGBA RGBA RGBA RGBA RGBA RGBA
	RGBA RGBA RGBA RGBA RGBA RGBA
	RGBA RGBA RGBA RGBA RGBA RGBA
- Separate Channels
	RRRRRR GGGGGG BBBBBB AAAAAA
	RRRRRR GGGGGG BBBBBB AAAAAA
	RRRRRR GGGGGG BBBBBB AAAAAA

Alpha Blending
- Foreground image has color and alpha: $\textbf{c}_f, \alpha_f$
- Background image has color and alpha: $\textbf{c}_b, \alpha_b$
- New color $\textbf{c}=\frac{\alpha_f\textbf{c}_f+(1-\alpha_f)\alpha_{b}\textbf{c}_b}{\alpha}$
- New alpha $\alpha_f+(1-\alpha_f)\alpha_b$
- If $\alpha=0$, then $\alpha_f=0,\alpha_b=0$, and $c=c_b$

Premultiplied Alpha
- $(\alpha R, \alpha G, \alpha B, \alpha)$
- What you see on the display
- Saves you computation
- But if $\alpha = 0$, then all color values are 0, so you lose color information
- If $\alpha$ is small, then we lose precision because of quantization, and so we lose color information here as well
- So we usually just do straight alpha: (R, G, B, $\alpha$) for image manipulation

Blending Modes
- Additive Blending
	- Just add image intensity values
	- $c=c_f+c_b$
	- Some use cases with GPUs
	- If there are alpha values, then $\alpha=clamp(\alpha_f+\alpha_b)$ and $c=\frac{\alpha_fc_f+\alpha_bc_b}{\alpha}$
- Difference Blending
	- $c=|\alpha_fc_f-c_b|$
- Multiply Blending
	- $c=c_fc_b$
	- Makes darker colors where blended
	- Good for putting dark text on an image, that you can still see the background image through
	- Works without alpha channel
	- With alpha channel, $c=\alpha_f(c_fc_b)+(a-\alpha_f)c_b$
- Screen Blending
	- $c=1-(1-c_f)(1-c_b)$
	- Opposite of multiply blending, makes lighter colors
	- Take inverse of both images, then do multiply blend, then take inverse of result
	- Looks similar to additive blending
