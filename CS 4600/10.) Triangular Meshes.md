### Triangles
- Triangles are nice!
- Made with 3 vertices
- Define a unique plane, unlike quads, they don't necessarily have to be planar
- Used to model lots of things, but
	- Not hair, represented as curves
- Even if they are not modeled as triangles, they are converted to them before rendering usually (again, not hair)
- Every point $\textbf{p}$ on the triangle plane can be written as a linear combo of the three vertices $\textbf{p}_0, \textbf{p}_1, \textbf{p}_2$
	- $\textbf{p}=\alpha\textbf{p}_0+\beta\textbf{p}_1+\gamma\textbf{p}_2$
### Barycentric Coordinates
- Barycentric Coordinates: $\begin{bmatrix}\alpha\\\beta\\\gamma\end{bmatrix}$
	- The dimensionality of the coordinate says nothing about the dimensionality of the points making the triangle!
- But position on plane should be able to be represented with just two values...
- $\alpha + \beta + \gamma = 1$, they are not independent!
- Linear interpolation of three values
- This is not specific to the triangle, any point on the plane can be represented as a linear combination of these 3 points! 
- But for the triangle: $0\leq\alpha\leq1$,  $0\leq\beta\leq1$,  $0\leq\gamma\leq1$
- If on the edge of the triangle, one of the weights (opposite vertex) will be zero, and just a linear interpolation of the two vertices making the edge
- If we move it entirely to one point, then just one weight is 1, the rest are 0
- For attributes stored on the vertices, we can interpolate their value on the triangle the same way!
	- For example, color: $c=\alpha c_0+\beta c_1+\gamma c_2$
- Easy to linearly interpolate these values!
- How do we find Barycentric coordinates given a point and the vertices? Various ways
	- Use point to split triangle into three triangles
	- Compute area of the three smaller triangles, get ratio relative to whole area
	- ![[Pasted image 20240925212442.png|300x300]]
	- These will still add to 1!
- GPU does this for us
	- Rasterizer produces fragments that correspond to each triangle, and computes Barycentric coordinates of each fragment using the center point
	- With the Barycentric coordinates, interpolates other vertex attributes
### Triangular Meshes
- List of vertices
	- $x,y,z$ position per vertex
	- xyzxyzxyzxyz defines 4 vertices
- List of triangles (faces)
	- Vertex indices
	- 012023 defines 2 triangles in Elements buffer
	- Lets us draw triangles, two elements (3 indices each, so 6, starting at 0)
	- Need an Elements buffer
	```JS
	gl.drawElements(gl.TRIANGLES, 6, gl.UNSIGNED_SHORT, 0);
	```
	
- Can also be clever with how we arrange our list of vertex positions
	- Triangle strip, each new point (other than the first 2) creates a triangle, 3 consecutive vertices always make one triangle
	- These are hard to make though! Might need multiple, and will end up duplicating some vertices again
```JS
gl.drawArrays(gl.TRIANGLE_STRIP, 0, 4);
```
- In a similar way, we can do a triangle fan! Where all triangles share the first vertex, and form a fan around that vertex
```JS
gl.drawArrays(g.TRIANGLE_FAN, 0, 4);
```
- Can use an elements array for both Triangle strips and fans too, to minimize duplication
```JS
gl.drawElements(gl.TRIANGLES, 2, ...);
gl.drawElements(gl.TRIANGLE_STRIP, 2, ...);
gl.drawElements(gl.TRIANGLE_FAN, 2, ...);
```
- Most efficient is to use element array with triangle strips
- In upcoming project just use triangles!
```JS
gl.drawArrays(gl.TRIANGLES, 0, 6);
```
