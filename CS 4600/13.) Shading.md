### Shading
- Basically how we color objects
- Computing light reflectance off of surfaces
### Lambertian (diffuse) Shading
- $\omega$ points towards light source from surface
- When light beam is perpendicular to surface, $\textbf{n}=\omega$
- ![[Pasted image 20241022202552.png]]
- When we tilt our surface, light beam is at an angle $\textbf{n} \neq \omega$, and covers a larger surface
- ![[Pasted image 20241022202540.png]]
- The area covered is defined by $\theta$ between $\omega, \textbf{n}$
- If the width of a light beam is 1, the area covered by the light beam at an angle is $s$, light per unit area is defined as $L$ at no angle, then light per unit area at an angle is $\frac{L}{s}$
- So it should look darker, less light per unit area
- ![[Pasted image 20241022203107.png]]
- Note $\cos\theta=\frac{1}{s}$, so $\frac{L}{s}=L\cos\theta$
- $L$ scales with $\cos\theta$ (Geometry Term)
- For a surface
- Call $K_d$ our color red
- ![[Pasted image 20241022203334.png]]
- Color determined by $K_d\cos\theta$
- Easy because $\cos\theta = (\textbf{n}\cdot\omega)$
- So $K_d\cos\theta=K_d(\textbf{n}\cdot\omega)$
	- Assuming $\textbf{n}, \omega$ are unit vectors
- What if we have a texture?
	- Do the same thing, just multiply color of texture by geometry term
- What if the intensity of the light $I$ is different?
- ![[Pasted image 20241022203727.png]]
- $C=I\cos\theta K_d$,, where $C$ is pixel color
- Called a Lambertian (Diffuse) Material
- With only diffuse reflections, you get no shine, it looks dull
- Specular reflections give a shiny look
- ![[Pasted image 20241022203957.png]]
### Specular Reflections
- We must also consider viewing direction (surface to view) $\textbf{v}$
### Phong Specular Reflections
- Uses reflection of $\omega$ off of plane, call the vector $\textbf{r}$
- Also has angle to $\textbf{n}$ of $\theta$ 
- Looks at angle $\phi$ between $\textbf{r},\textbf{v}$
- Use $IK_s(\cos\phi)^\alpha=IK_s(\textbf{v}\cdot\textbf{r})^\alpha$
	- $K_s,\alpha$ are material properties (specular coefficient (how shiny) it is, and another number)
- If we put this on a material, we get $C=I(\cos\theta K_d+K_s(\cos\phi)^\alpha)$
	- $K_s$ is some colored value, but usually some shade of gray
	- $\alpha$ determines shape of specular reflections
	- Diffuse (from Lambertian) + specular
- Why doesn't geometry term impact specular term?
	- In Phong Material Model, there is a hidden $\cos\theta$ term
	- $C=I\cos\theta(K_d+K_s\frac{(\cos\phi)^\alpha}{\cos\theta})$
- Modified Phong Material Model
	- $C=I\cos\theta(K_d+K_s(\cos\phi)^\alpha)$
- **Phong Material Model:**  $C=I max(0,\cos\theta)(K_d+K_s\frac{(max(0,\cos\phi))^\alpha}{\cos\theta})$
	- Because angles could be negative
	- $\cos\theta = \textbf{n}\cdot\omega, \cos\phi=\textbf{r}\cdot\textbf{v}$
- To get $\textbf{r}$: $\textbf{r}=2(\omega\cdot\textbf{n})\textbf{n}-\omega$
	- Negate $\omega$
	- Project original $\omega$ onto $\textbf{n}$, $(\omega\cdot\textbf{n})\textbf{n}$
	- Add two of these
- ![[Pasted image 20241022210209.png]]
- ![[Pasted image 20241022210221.png]]
	- Very smooth! $\alpha$ is extremely high for mirrors
### Blinn Material Model
- Considers half angle vector $\textbf{h}=\frac{\omega+\textbf{v}}{|\omega+\textbf{v}|}$
- ![[Pasted image 20241022210431.png]]
- Define $\phi$ as angle between $\textbf{h}$ and $\textbf{n}$
	- $\cos\phi=\textbf{n}\cdot\textbf{h}$
- Why do we do this?
	- Changes shape of the specular mode
### Blinn vs. Phong Material Model
- ![[Pasted image 20241022210755.png]]
	- More circular! More realistic!
- ![[Pasted image 20241022210817.png]]
- Notice how in both there is no light on the opposing side!
- If we have a back background, we can't see backside at all
- ![[Pasted image 20241022210954.png]]
- We fix this with ambient light
### Ambient Light
- Add some light everywhere
- Blinn/Phong Material Model: $C=I(\cos\theta K_d + K_s(\cos\phi)^\alpha)+I_aK_a$
	- $K_a$ is ambient color, $I_a$ is independently defined ambient light intensity
	- What is $K_a$?
		- Not really anything, so we can just set  $K_a=K_d$
### Final Material Model (Blinn/Phong)
- $C=I(\cos\theta K_d+K_s(\cos\phi)^\alpha)+I_aK_a$
- Material Properties:
	- $K_a=K_d$ is diffuse color (just color I think)
	- $K_s$ is specular coefficient
	- $\alpha$ determines size of reflection
- For Phong:
	- $\phi$ is the angle between $\textbf{r}$ and $\textbf{v}$
		- $\textbf{r}=2(\omega\cdot\textbf{n})\textbf{n}-\omega$ is reflection of $\omega$ off surface
		- $\textbf{v}$ is viewing direction
		- $\cos\phi=\textbf{r}\cdot\textbf{v}$
- For Blinn:
	- $\phi$ is the angle between $\textbf{n}$ and $\textbf{h}=\frac{\omega+\textbf{v}}{|\omega+\textbf{v}|}$
		-  $\cos\phi=\textbf{n}\cdot\textbf{h}$
### Lights
- Directional Light
	- Intensity, Direction
- Point/Spot Light
	- Intensity, Position
- Area Light
	- Rectangle, Disk, Sphere, Mesh, ...
- Sky Light (Environment Light)
	- Light coming from lots of far away directions, possibly with different intensities, can be determined with a function, or use a texture that tells how much light comes from each direction
	- Can use this as a background

### Image-Based Lighting

### Question
- What if we have multiple light sources in a scene?
- Light is additive, so we compute diffuse and specular reflections from all light sources, and add them together!
