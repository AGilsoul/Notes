### Something Odd
```C++
int main() {
	int count = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i < 10,000; i++) count++;
	cout << count << endl;
	int values[10] {};
	values[1, 3] = 5;
	cout << values[1] << endl;
	cout << values[2] << endl;
	cout << values[3] << endl;
}
```
- These will all print zeros, except for `values[3]`! The stuff after the comma is what is used
### Qt Assignment
- Make sure you follow the rules on where a model object can be used
	- In the view, only to make connect calls!
- May see flashing issues with the timer
	- The Qtimer is not designed to be very precise
	- You can use (and other variations for singleShot)
	- `timer.setTimerType(Qt::PreciseTimer);`
### Representation
- Given a set of things, how can we represent those things?
- For example, some possible mouse click activity
	- Clicked, pressed, released, double-clicked
	- Strings: "clicked", "pressed", etc.
	- Numbers: 0 means clicked, 1 means pressed, ...
	- Const variables: const int CLICKED = 0
- Can we generalize this?
### C++ Enums
- Example enum
```C++
enum Color { red, green, blue };
Color r = red;
bool isRed(Color color) {
	return color == red;
}
```
- Provides type safety
```C++
int main() {
	cout << isRed(blue) << endl; // works
	cout << isRed(0) << endl; // doesn't work "No matching function"
	cout << isRed(3) << endl; // doesn't work "No matching function"
}
```
- Enum advantages
	- They define a type
		- Once it is a type, the compiler can check the type
- They make an implicit mapping like "0 means red" an explicit mapping
	- red is red and green is green and blue is blue
- The enum can be moddified without breaking everything
	- `enum Color { red, green, yellow, blue };`
- Can make an enum have class scope
```C++
enum class color { red, green, blue};
bool isRed(Color color) {
	return color == Color::red;
}
```
- This is nice, looks like a public static const inside a class
### Waterfall Review
- Development time to planning
	- Should make implementation straightforward
	- Business goal: coders can be low-quality
		- Just doing syntactical conversation
		- Business likes this
		- Programmers do not

### UML Standards Development
- Unified Modeling Language
- UML: open standard controlled by OMG
	- http://www.uml.org
- UML 1.0 (1997)
- UML 2.0 (2004)
- Current release 2.5.1 (2017)
### What is UML?
- A language and platform independent way of describing different views of a system
	- Has a strong OO emphasis
- Has graphical diagrams to show these views based on UML notation
- Views are based on models of the system
	- Models are abstractions of subsets of the system
### UML Views
- ![[Pasted image 20241024135819.png]]
### Some Basic Views
- Class Diagram
	- Help formalize the architecture of the system
- Sequence Diagram
	- Show the interaction between objects over time
		- Signal goes to view
		- Signal returns to model
- State diagram
	- Represent the possible states of an object or system and the transitions between them
### Class Diagrams
- What techniques can we use to help develop our sense of the system?
- Example description:
	- "The game has a player moving through levels and avoiding enemies. When the player has collected enough treasure, the boss fight begins."
- A class is a rectangle divided into three parts
	- Class name
	- Class attributes (i.e. data members, variables)
	- Class operations (i.e. methods)
- Modifiers
	- Private: -
	- Public: +
	- Protected # 
	- Static: Underlined (i.e. shared among all members of the class)
	- Types : Type
- Abstract class: Name in *italics*
- Add a QTModel to a project
- ![[Pasted image 20241024140242.png]]
### Underline Nouns Approach
- OO view
	- Evaluate nouns as objects
		- Game, player, level, enemy, treasure, boss
	- Reject objects that do not have independent services
		- Is treasure just collected or do we interact with it?
	- Other words may be properties or attributes
		- The boss enemy
	- Or events
		- Avoid, move, collect
### Qt UML
- In a project add a new model
	- You can also drag header file in but it doesn't seem to populate details
	- Add a class box
	- Check the box to "Show members"
- You can add instance variables in UML style
	- -age: integer
- Methods seem to want to be more in C++ syntax
	- +setName(string newName);

### Relationships
- The relationship between classes is where the complexity in design comes from
- Indicated by arrows in UML diagrams
- Inheritance
	- Triangle arrow to superclass
- ![[Pasted image 20241024140449.png]]
### Association (a form of Dependency)
- Show that classes must know about each other to work
	- Client and server
	- Game and dice
- No arrow means bidirectional
- ![[Pasted image 20241024140551.png]]
### Multiplicity
- Can show if the relationship is one-to-one or one-to-many or many-to-many
- Label the arrow
- ![[Pasted image 20241024140620.png]]
### Aggregation
- Aggregation means class A has a class B, but there is not implied ownership
	- container/contained relationship
	- deleting Car does not imply destruction of wheel
- ![[Pasted image 20241024140659.png]]
### Composition
- Implies control over composed object
	- Also container/contained with life cycle dependence
- ![[Pasted image 20241024140726.png]]
### Some Style Guidelines
- Aggregation/Composition
	- The whole should be to the left of the part
- Inheritance
	- Subclass below superclass
### Tools
- Tools can generate
	- Code from these class diagrams
	- Diagrams from code
	- What about this idea that there is inherent unavoidable complexity in software?
- Professor's thoughts
	- A little class hierarchy with a handful of boxes and some arrows is about right for a class project
### Group Project
- Groups of 4-6 people
- Must be in a group
- Go to class Tuesday!
### Teams
- There will be a signup page for your group on Tuesday
- Team name (awesome name)
- Participants
- Must be able to meet together during a lab session (with permission TA help hours)
- will have team eval forms to fill out throughout the process
### Class Structure
- Typically 30-50 minutes each lecture for groups to meet and make progress
- Lab time mostly be time to meet as groups and have some check-in progress with course staff
