### Qt Review
- A Qt program typically is a class derived from a Qt Widget
- A .ui file defines UI elements built in the designer
- Widgets emit signals which are connected to slots
	- Some of this is in code
	- Some specified graphically in the Designer and hidden inside the class built from the .ui
- In the constructor, connect the signal and the slot
```C++
connect(ui->pushbutton,
		&QPushButton::clicked,
		this,
		&MainWindow::buttonClickedSlot);
```
### Connect
- You will also see a lot of SIGNAL SLOT macro style connect calls - that is an older style but still used a lot
```C++
connect(sender,
		SIGNAL(destroyed(QObject*)),
		this,
		SLOT(objectDestroyed(QObject*)));
```
### C++ Delegates
- C++ doesn't really have a specialized concept of delegates
	- "Oh, those are just function/method pointers"
- A delegate is to hand off responsibility to something else
- A useful architecture
### Inheritance vs. Delegation
```C++
class Rectangle {
	int h, 2;
public:
	Rectangle(int h, int w) : h(h), w(w) {}
	int area() { return h * w; }
	void changeDimensions(int a, int b) { h = a; w = b; }
};

class Square : public Rectangle {
public:
	Square(int l) : Rectangle(l, l) {}
}
```
### Subclass vs. Subtype
- A subclass provides
	- Code reuse from base classes
- A subtype of a class implies some substitutability
	- If B inherits from A, then
	- If foo(A) does something, then foo(B) should also be allowed
### Liskov Substitution Principle
- A function that accepts base classes must be able to use derived classes without knowing it
- Problem: what if a function wants to change the aspect ratio
	- Supported by Rectangle
	- Should not be supported by Square
	- Square is not a true subtype of Rectangle!
### Delegate Structure
```C++
class Square {
	Rectangle r;
	Square(l) : r(l,l) {};
	int area() { return r.area(); }
}
```
- Just take the functionality you want
- You can get fancier with method pointers to have this class area be a pointer to the rectangle area
### Constructor Delegation
- Can call a constructor in the initializer list of a different constructor
```C++
Rectangle() {
	id = generateID();
}

Rectangle(int h, int w) : Rectangle() {
	height = h;
	width = w;
}
```
### Qt Structure
- User interfaces make for complicated code
- Interactions are difficult to analyze
- Leads to the concept of "separation of concerns"
	- modularity
	- decrease coupling of code
- In UI this is often expressed as model-view-[controller] architecture
- ![[Pasted image 20241022194242.png]]
### Model-View
- Merge View and Controller together
	- The important thing is to keep the application logic and data distinct from the interface
	- What plays the role of the controller in Qt?
### Make Qt Example
- Button->adds 1 to val->shows on spin box
- Button and spin box are the view
- The val and adding to the val are the model
### Model-View in Qt
- Use signals and slots to communicate
- What is different between the code
	- Calling a method in the button class directly
	- Emitting a signal which the button class connects to a method
- Classes have to inherit from QObject (or its derived classes) to be part of the signal-slot ecosystem
- Qt has a model-view system, but it is for specific widgets, like a listModel-listView
### Assignment
- Make a Simon game
	- Computer plays a sequence of lights
	- You have to replicate the sequence
		- Not a timed thing, just a memory game
	- The sequence grows longer with each round
- Optional pair
- Next assignments are all team-based
