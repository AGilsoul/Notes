### Assignment 3
- Call harulib functions following the pattern of pdfExample.cpp
- What is going on here?
```C++
// This ugly function defines where any following text will bbe placed on the page. The cos/sin stuff is actually defining a 2D rotation matrix

HPDF_Page_SetTextMatrix(page, cos(rad1), sin(rad1), -sin(rad1), cos(rad1), x, y);
```
- You can look at the code to see what rad1 is
```rad1 = (angle2 - 90) / 180 * 3.141592;```
- What is this?
	- Shift by 90 degrees and convert to radians
### Compiling Review
```
point: main.o point.o
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o point main.o point.o
main.o: main.cpp $(INCLUDE)/point.h
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -I$(INCLUDE) -c main.cpp
point.o: point.cpp $(INCLUDE)/point.h
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -I$(INCLUDE) -c point.cpp
```
- When making an executable, list all the implementations (.o or library .a, or can be .cpp)
	- If not, get undefined references
- The library goes on the end
### General A3 Advice
- If a command sends some information to the screen, read it
```
$ make HaruPDF.o
g++ -c HaruPDF.cpp
Blah blah, cannot find "hpdf.h"
```
- What do we see here? Develop a theory as to why it might be wrong
- Windows treats hArUpDf.CpP the same as haruPDF.cpp
	- The autograder runs on a Linux machine
	- It does care about case
- Makefiles will sometimes apply default rule if it cannot find a matching target
	- If you see it compiling and ignoring all your include and library flags, look for a typo in your Makefile
### A Resizable Int Array Class
- We need some data members and a constructor
```C++
class DArray {
private:
	int len_;
	int* data_;
public:
	DArray(int len = 5): len_(len) {
		data_ = new int[len];
	}
}
```
### Object Lifespan
- Data members
```C++
int len_;  // or size_t
int *data_;
```
- Constructor
```C++
DArray(int len = 5) {
	len_ = len;
	data_ = new int[len_];
}
```
- What does this do? ```DArray d;```
	- Allocate space for the data members on stack
	- Assign values in constructor
		- Allocate an int array on heap
- When do things go away?
	- Data members go away when d leaves scope
### Destructor
- Since we 'new' some memory, we need to delete it
	- In the destructor
```C++
~DArray() {
	delete [] data_;
}
```
### NULL and nullptr
- A pointer that is not pointing to an object should be set to nullptr
	- NULL is older C++
	- You don't need to do this after a delete
		- If you are trying to use the pointer after a delete, your code is hopelessly wrong anyway
### Access
- Make it act like a normal array with []
```C++
int operator[](int index) const {
	return data_[index];
}

int& operator[](int index) {
	return data_[index];
}
```
### How to read const
- const says things cannot be altered
```C++
const int pi = 3; // must initialize
const int * vp; // * to const int
int const * vp; // same
int * const cp // const * to varying int
```
- Const modifies token to left
	- Read left to right
	- If on far left, move over 1 to right
### Const in Methods
- Can declare return type const
```const int val() {...}```
- Can declare the method cannot change data members
```int val() const {...}```
- A getter should not modify the state of the object
### Const in Parameters
- Parameters can be const
- One important use - cheat the pass-by-value cost
```C++
void method(BigObject b) {...}
void method(BigObject& b) {...}
void method(const bigObject& b) {...}
```
- The first has an expensive copy cost, the second makes b changeable in the method, and the third skips the copy but no changes allowed
### Issues with const
- Const is infectious
	- If something is made const, then code it uses also needs to be const to guarantee no changes
	- This is a good thing, but annoying when you first start adding const
### Resizing
- Need to
	- allocate a new array
	- copy existing data
	- delete old array
	- set data members
```C++
void resize(int size) {
	int *newdata = new int[size];
	for (int i = 0; i < len_ && i < size; i++) {
		newdata[i] = data_[i];
	}
	delete [] data_;
	data_ = newdata;
	len_ = size;
}
```
### Problems
- Assignment is an operator
	- Why return Type&?
- The default operator= copies the data members
	- Just copies the address in the pointer
	- Both copies point to the same data_ array
```C++
Type& operator=(const Type& rhs);

// The default does this
data_ = rhs.data_
len_ = rhs.len_
```
### The Rule of Three
- When a class manages a resource
	- new memory
	- open file
- Need explicit
	- destructor
	- copy constructor
	- assignment operator
	- C++11 has a move syntax
		- Transfers data from one object to another without copying
```C++
~DArray()
DArray(const DArray& other)
DArray & operator=(const DArray& other)
```
### Copy Constructor
- Perform a deep copy
	- allocate mem
	- copy vals
	- nothing to delete since not modifying other
```C++
DArray(const DArray& other) {
	len_ = other.len_;
	data_ = new int[len_];
	for (int i = 0; i < len_; i++) {
		data_[i] = other.data_[i];
	}
}
```
### Assignment Operator
- Copy then swap idiom
```C++
DArray& operator=(DArray other) {
	swap(data_, other.data_);
	swap(len_, other.len_);
	return *this
}
```
- Pass-by-value does copy
- Exchange pointers and primitves
- other gets destroyed when leaving the method
	- but it contains the original lvalue allocated memory
### Copy then Swap in Action
```C++
// fill with 1,2,3
DArray first; 
// fill with 4,5,6
DArray second; 
// pass first by value to assignment operator 
second = first; 
// DArray other(first), other is 1,2,3 copy of first
// Swap second data with other data
// Local variable other leaves scope
// Cleans up resources
```
### Strategies for Resource Management
- Resource management is error prone
	- int* vals = new int[4];
	- when does vals get deleted?
- Connect vals resources to object-lifetime stack behavior
	- delete when leaving scope
- Wrap a resource in a stack-object
- This is what DArray is
	- DArray objects can be made on the stack
		- DArray handles the destruction
### Resource Acquisition is Initialization
- This concept is formalized in an idiom
	- RAII
		- Wrap resources in a class
		- Acquire resources in a constructor
		- Release resources in destructor
	- Make resource availability a class invariant
		- No need to make open()/close() methods, logic to check if resource is initialized, etc.
