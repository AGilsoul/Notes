### A5
- What are the  semantics of this - what does it do?
```C++
QTimer::singleShot(200, this, &Foo::doSomething);
QTimer::singleShot(200, this, &Foo::doNexThing);
```
- Both slots are executed roughly 200 ms in the future at roughly the same time
- What are some limitations on where the slot can live?
	- Given a model-view structure, the only object the model knows about is the model and the same for the view. So the slot has to be where the timer is set up
	- How can we simplify having a bunch of slots that just emit signals to the "other side"
### C++ Lambda Expressions
- Define some anonymous function
	- Most basic
		- `[](){}`, the `[]` is called the lambda introducer and contains the capture clause
	- With parameters
		- `[](int a){}`
	- With return type
		- `[](int a) -> int { return 1; }`
- Capture some variables of the enclosing function for use in the lambda expression
	- Capture by value
	```C++
	int value = 100;
	[value](int a) { cout << value; }
	```
	- Capture by reference
	```C++
	int value = 100;
	[&value](int a){ value++; }
	```
### Lambdas and singleShot
- You may find yourself setting up a slot in the model that just emits a signal to the view (or other way around) and connecting the slot to a timer
- Consider emitting the signal in a lambda expression
	- The signal is part of the object, so capture this pointer to the object
	- `[this]{ emit doSomething(); }`
### How Do You Work on a Software Project?
- Assume something like a mid-sized assignment - maybe bigger than Trie or Haru
	- How do you get started?
	- What does your workflow look like?
- What causes failure?
### Many of Us
- "Cowboy coders"
	- Autonomous coders
	- Coders in charge of schedule, tools, style, design, language, frameworks, etc.
- "Chaos model"
	- Resolve most important issue first
- "Code and fix"
	- Start generating code right away
### Themes of Mythical Man-Month
- The second-system effect
	- The most dangerous system an architect will design is the second one
- Fixed number of errors
	- In complex systems an attempt to fix errors will introduce others
- Progress tracking
	- "How does  a large software project get to be one year late?" One day at a time!
- Conceptual Integrity
	- Architects must design system separate from implementation
	- Novel features should not be included unless it fits well
- Surgical team metaphor
	- Brooks believes that good programmers are 5x-10x more productive than mediocre ones, so teams should support the good ones
- Communication
	- Formal docs, lots of team meetings
### Waterfall Software Development
- Described a single-pass of stages
- Adapted from large construction projects
	- Freeze requirements at each stage
	- Not many chances to iterate on a building
- ![[Pasted image 20241024133442.png]]
### Requirements
- Often uses a SRS (Software Requirements Specification) form
	- Intro
		- Purpose
		- System overview
	- Interfaces
		- system/user/hardware/communication
	- Constraints
		- memory/site/scale/performance
	- Attributes
		- reliability/security/portability
- Basis for agreement between customer and developer
- Reduce development effort
	- Expose omissions, inconsistencies, misunderstandings
- Basis for cost estimation
- Foundation for future enhancements
### IEEE 830 Standard
- Documents on recommended practice
	- http://www.math.uaa.alaska.edu/~afkjm/cs401/IEEE830.pdf
	- A comprehensive view of an SRS
- This is not a design document
	- It is a functional requirement specification
	- Requirements should be verifiable
		- "A clerk typist grade 4 can do function X in Z min after 1 hr of training" rather than "A typist can do function X"
### From the Template
- ![[Pasted image 20241024133913.png]]
- Alternatively, write "use cases"
	- Basically describe how people want to to use the software
### Other Waterfall Steps
- Design
	- Design is not coding
- Implementation 
	- Code up parts of the system
- Integration and Testing
	- Put modules together
	- System testing
- Maintenance
	- Longest and most costly phase
	- Only real hope for reliability
### Waterfall Pros and Cons
- Pro
	- Tangible products at different phases
	- Emphasis on planning
	- Easy to manage - matches structure of big companies
- Con
	- Hard to adapt to changing requirements
	- Testing/working software is late in process
	- People hate paperwork
### When to Use Waterfall
- Requirements are clear and fixed
- Customer not actively involved or available throughout
- Budget or schedule strictly fixed
- Developer team needs complete spec
	- Maybe turnover in developers
- Technology is well-understood
### Agile
- The "modern" alternative
- Will cover late
### Code Review
- Not so good

- Better
