### Some C++ Class Reminders
Header Ex.h
```C++
#ifndef EX_H
#define EX_H
class Ex {
	int x;
public:
	void printX();
};
#endif
```
- The #define really is making a text macro that replaces text in the file with something else. These defines used to be used for const, like #define RULELEN 8
- Can do dangerous things #define int float
- Use an include guard name that does not look like a variable or class name!
- ALL CAPS< THE FILENAME WITH _ INSTEAD OF .
Source Ex.cpp
```C++
#include "Ex.h"
// no class
// no int x;

void Ex::printX() { code }
```
- The .cpp #includes the header file so it knows the declaration of the class
- It only has implementations!
	- No pretend declarations of instance variables that are just global scope variables
### Code Review
- Discuss the following code
- Look at
	- Expression of ideas
		- Logic, etc.
	- Variable names
	- Small style issues
		- Spacing
		- Indents
	- Modularity
	- Separation of concerns
		- Does the function do one thing and do it well
```C++
void computeNextGeneration(int current[], int next[], int genLength, int ruleSetArray[]) {
	int calculatedNeighborhoodValue; // 1.)
	for (int i = 0; i <= genLength - 1; i++) { // 2.)
		if (i == 0 || i == genLength - 1) { // 3.)
			next[i] = current[i];
		}
	}

	for (int i = 0; i <= genLength - 1; i++) {
		if (i == genLength - 2) { // 4.)
			break;
		}
		else {
			calculatedNeighborhoodValue = convertNeighborhoodToIndex(current[i], current[i+1], current[i+2]);
		}
		next[i+1] = ruleSetArray[calculatedNeighborhoodValue]; // 5.)
	}
	displayCurrentGeneration(next, genArrayLength); //6.)
}
```
-1.) Declare variables close to where they are used
-2.) A standard loop uses < iterations as condition
-3.) This is a loop that only needs the beginning and end
-4.) This is a band-aid on a flawed loop. Fix the loop.
-5.) Try to work on current index instead of offsetting
-6.) This is a big issue. Let a function do one thing. Now, we cannot compute a generation without displaying it. This idea is called "Separation of Concerns"
### Back to Makefiles
- A Makefile has a bunch of targets, dependencies, and build commands
- The time stamp of the target is compared with the time stamps of the dependencies
- If dependencies are newer (or need to be built themselves)
	- Rebuild the target
### Add Variables
- Define compilation properties with variables
```
#use variables to define compilation properties
CC = g++
CFLAGS = -Wall
```
- Use the variables like $(CC) $(CFLAGS) in place of g++
### Other Handy Parts
- Add a 'clean' rule
	- Sometimes you want to make sure everything gets recompiled
```
clean:
	rm -f pointTest *.o
```
- A 'test' rule can be handy
```
test: pointTest
	./pointTest > testLog.txt
```
### Example Makefile
```
CC = g++
CFLAGS = -Wall

pointTest: Point.o pointTest.o Point.h
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o pointTest pointTest.o Point.o

pointTest.o: pointTest.cpp Point.h Point.cpp
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c pointTest.cpp

Point.o: Point.h Point.cpp
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c Point.cpp

clean:
	rm -f pointTest *.o

test: pointTest
	./pointTest > testLog.txt
```
### Libraries
- Instead of listing many .o files
	- Turn useful and 'finished' collections of .o files into libraries
- Turn the Point class into a library
	- We will not normally turn small collections of our code into libraries
### Reorganizing the Code
- Put include files in one folder and .cpp in another for point related things
```
Point/
	include/
		Point.h
	src/
		Point.cpp
main.cpp
Makefile
```
### Compile Point.o
- Use -I flag to tell compiler to look in that directory for #include things
	- In src need to go up a directory and then down into the include directory to find Point.h
		- ```-I../include```
	- The full compile line from the src folder would look like
		- ```g++ -I../include -C Point.cpp```
### Change the Makefile
- The pointTest.cpp has a #include "Point.h"
	- This looks in the current folder for the .h
- Define INCLUDE variable
	- ```INCLUDE=./Point/include```
- Use -I flag to tell compiler to look in that directory for #include things
	- DO NOT modify the #include to have some path, use an include flag
- Use INCLUDE to point to .h file
	- ```pointTest.o: pointTest.cpp $(INCLUDE)/point.h```
- Use a flag to tell the compiler to search the provided folder for .h files
```
pointTest.o: pointTest.cpp $(INCLUDE)/point.h
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -I$(INCLUDE) -c pointTest.cpp
```
- The top INCLUDE is a dependency check if the .h has changed. The bottom one is telling the compiler where to look for the include files
### What to do with all the .o files
- Turn multiple .o files int a library
	- Share code with headers and .a or .so library file
		- .a for static library
		- .so for shared, dynamically-loaded library
- To make a library
	- Archive command 'ar'
		- ```ar -rcs libPoint.a Point.o other.o```
	- We only have one .o in the Point folder. So not much of a library
### Using a Static Library
- Create a variable POINT that is a path to the point folder with an include, src, lib subfolders
- To use this library of provided code
	- When compiling the .cpp into .o files
		1.) Path to the header files
		```
		pointTest.o: pointTest.cpp $(POINT)/include/point.h
			$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -I$(POINT)/include -c pointTEst.cpp
		```
	- When linking the .o and .a into an executable
		2.) Path to the .a file with -L
		3.) Name of the .a file with -lname or just libname.a
		- -l adds back in the lib and .a
		- libraries go on the end of this build line!
	- At this time, assume Point is finished and not part of the Makefile dependencies
```
pointTest: pointTest.o
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o pointTest -L$(POINT)/lib
pointTest.o -lPoint
```
- Those 3 rules are really all you need
	- Path to include when compiling
	- Path to libraries and name of library when linking
- But these are going to cause you a lot of problems
- Remember these rules!
- When compiling the .cpp -> .o files
	- Path to the folder the header files are in (-I part)
	- No library .a used
- When linking the .o and .a -> executable
	- No include path needed!
	- Do have any local .o files that are needed
	- Path to the .a file -LsomePath
	- Name of the .a file -lname or just libname.a
		- -I adds back in the lib and .a to the name
		- libraries go on the end of build line ordering
			- A library that has code that another library needs goes after the calling library
### Makefile: You Try
- Project Structure
```
ChatGPTV20
	Makefile
	AI.cpp
	AI.h
	Conquer.cpp
	Smart
		include
			Smart.h
		lib
			libsmart.a
```
- Makefile
	- Executable Conquer
	- From AI, Conquer, and Smart Library
- What do we need?
- First, turn .cpp into .o
```
AI.o: AI.cpp AI.h
	g++ -I./Smart/include -c AI.cpp
Conquer.o: Conquer.cpp Conquer.h AI.h
	g++ -I./Smart/include -c Conquer.cpp
```
- Conquer needs the Smart path if Conquer.cpp includes AI.h and AI.h includes Smart.h
- Add rule for executable
- Add executable (often up top)
```
Conquer: AI.o Conquer.o
	g++ -o Conquer -L./Smart/lib AI.o Conquer.o -lsmart
```
### Design Patterns
- What are design patterns?
	- Not code reuse
		- Not a library - a pattern needs recoding for each new context
	- Solution strategy/architecture reuse
	- Point out some subtle problems and provide a potential solutions
### Levels of Reuse
- Frameworks: .Net, Qt, Android
- Design Patterns:
	- Toolkits (libraries)
	- Idioms - Example: Include Guards
	- Languages
### Gang of Four (GoF)
- Design Patterns book launched this concept for software
	- Borrowed from "patterns" idea in architecture
	- 4 authors
### Facade Design Pattern
- Facade
	- An outward appearance that is maintained to conceal a less pleasant or credible reality
- Problem: external code may be difficult to use and end up tightly-coupled to yours
- Solution: wrap a subset of external library in an easier-to-use interface
### Assignment 3
- Make a facade for a C-style pdf-creation library
- Use your Sine class
- Make an application that ties the two together to make text follow the sine wave in a pdf
### Look at libharu
- Build with cmake
	- cmake is a tool to generate Makefiles
		- Look at things installed on your system and decides what to use
			- For example, g++ or clang or mingw
	- Then, use make
- It is a C library
	- Function calls
	- Pointers
	- Return errors instead of exceptions (ignore errors)
### A3
- Three main chunks of code
	- HaruPDF
		- setup haru stuff for a page
		- place a character at a position/orientation on page
	- Sine
		- Move along a sine wave in jumps with ++
		- Has its own coordinate system
	- Project
		- get text
		- loop over text
			- get sine position
			- convert to some coordinates for pdf
			- place on pdf
			- move to next sine curve spot for a letter
- Keep it modular
	- Haru class does haru tasks
	- Sine class does sine actions
	- main talks to each to do the task
