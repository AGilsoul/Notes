### Tool-chains
- Software development requires a huge number of tools
- The better you are at them the more efficient you are as a developer
- Tool-chain examples are VS+GitHub, terminal and git
### Development in larger systems
 - Use large code bases (libraries)
 - Develop within large code bases
 - Skills in "fitting in" with existing code
 - Google C++ code style is a fascinating read
### Small team development
- Using and developing software requirements
- Architecting systems
- Communicating systems via UML (Unified Markup Language)
- Evolving and maintaining code
- Communicating and interaction on a team
- Code review
- Teamwork is required for this course!
### Tests
- A single midterm
- No final exam
	- That exam time will be for project presentations
- Quizzes
	- Every two weeks or so
	- Last 30 minutes of class
- Syllabus has all dates
### Turning in Assignments
- Late work
	- 10% off for 1 day
	- 20% off for 2 days
	- One late pass for one assignment for no penalty
		- It gets used on the first late assignment
		- No communication required
		- Can't be used for group projects, can be used for pair projects
		- Don't try to save them if you are sick, that's what they're for
- Talk to professor about documented emergencies, longer-term medical issues, etc.
### Texts
- Largely online resources
	- Read the posted resources
- Weekly quizzes on reading and lecture material
### Course Communication
- Piazza
- Email directly for more personal topics
- Office is 3146 MEB
### Technical Info
- What machines will we use
	- Docker Linux instances
		- Light weight virtual machine sorta thing
		- Works through terminal
		- Matches a lot of modern code development styles
		- Attach an editor to a possibly remote instance
		- Share instances to keep environment consistent
- Look under course resources
	- Get help if not working
	- Back things up
### Docker Desktop
 - One container for this class
 - Docker can open a terminal in the container
 - You can have a terminal on the host machine
 - VSCode runs on the host machine but can edit files in folders shared between both host and container, can embed a terminal in the container
### C++ History
- C was developed in the 70s
	- Widespread adoption
	- Efficient with resources
	- First choice for new architectures and embedded systems
- C++
	- Started extending in '79
	- 1998 ratification
	- Added OOP
	- Templates (generics)
	- New C++ releases added higher-level data structures, modern language features
### C++ Principles
- Retain the power of C with a better dev experience
### Command Line Compilation
- In a terminal/xterm/???
	- "g++ -o test test.cpp" to compile to test
	- ./test to run
- C++ must be recompiled on each machine
### C Leftovers
- Still need a lot of C in C++
- Need to recognize C parts of language
- Built-in types
	- char (1 byte, 'a'), int (4 bytes, 12), double (8 bytes, 12.01), bool
### Undefined Behavior
- C++ allows this
### Initialization
```C++
int x = 1; // C-like
int x(0);  // Construcotr
int x{0};  // C++11 standard
```
### Arrays
```C++
int values[10]; // fixed size
```
### Functions
```C++
returnType functionName(type p1, type p2, ...) {
	body
}
```
- Must be declared before they are called
- Can just be a declaration and not the definition
```C++
returnType functionName(type p1, type p2, ...);
```
- example
```C++
bool isEven(int number); // Forward declaration
bool isOdd(int number);

bool isOdd(int number) {
	if (number == 0) return false;
	else return isEven(number - 1);
}

bool isEven(int number) {
	if (number == 0) return true;
	else return isOdd(number - 1);
}
```
