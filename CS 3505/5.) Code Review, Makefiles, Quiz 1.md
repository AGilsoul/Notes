### Code Style
- We are sometimes going to discuss code
- Sometimes some of your code
- This is a common activity in software development
- It should not be done in a mean way
	- Think of constructive
	- But you also have to be willing to learn from it
- Discuss
	- What does it do?
	- How can it be clearer?
```C++
string temp = "";
if (scaleNum <= 0) {}
else {
	while (scaleNum > 1) {
		temp += " ";
		scaleNum--;
	}
}
```
- Fixed number of iterations, can use a for loop
- More descriptive variable names
```C++
string whiteSpace = "";
for (int i = 0; i < scaleNum; i++) {
	whiteSpace += " ";
}
```
### A1 Code Style
- Discuss this impressively compact form
```C++
for (int i = 0; i < numCells; i++) {
	int right = (i+1 < numCells)? currentGen[i+1]: 0;
	int current = currentGen[i];
	int left = (i-1>0)? currentGen[i-1]: 0;

	nextGen[i] = ruleSet[convertNeighbordhoodToIndex(left, current, right)];
}
```
- Uses lots of ternary statements
- Encoded incorrectly!
- Discuss
```C++
// Evaluate index for next generation
if (rule[val] == 1) {
	next[i] = 1;
}
else {
	next[i] = 0;
}
```
- This can be done without if statement
- val is used as an index, should be named as such!
```C++
next[i] = rule[valIndex];
```
### Code Review 1
- Submit your A1 to Canvas by Friday
- Do your review by next Tuesday
	- 5-10 minutes per review
- Pick some specifics to say
- No generalities like "variable names are good"
- Read the posted A1 Discussion page for some ideas on things to look for
### C++ Project Structure
- C++ has somewhat complicated approaches for managing projects
	- Designed before all-encompassing IDEs were a thing
### G++ Compilation
- g++ really does two things
	- Compile the source
	- Link the files together
		- If Point(x,y) is defiend in Point.cpp, then when main.cpp is compiled to it
			- Sees the prototype of Point(x,y) in the .h file
			- Enters that in some internal table
			- When it is used in main.cpp it knows it should exist
			- During linking, it makes the connection between the prototype table and the actual compiled interpretation
```C++
#ifndef POINT_H  // if no point.h defined 
#define POINT_H  // then define it
	...          // rest of file
#endif
```
### Object Files
- You can compile without linking
	```g++ -c point.cpp```
- This makes an object file ```point.o``` which is the compiled code ready for linking
### Compilation of Multi-File Projects
- Will quickly get unwieldy
```g++ -o point main.cpp point.cpp```
or
```g++ -o point main.o point.o```
- Make
	- A system for compiling projects
	- Uses a Makefile to define compilation rules
	- Speeds compilation by only redoing 'touched files'
### Makefiles
- Basic Makefile setup
```
"Thing to make": "what it depends on"
"How to make it"
```
- A simple Makefile for point is
	- Note that the .h is in the dependences but not in the compilation line - the .cpp code includes it
```
point: main.cpp point.h point.cpp
	g++ -o point main.cpp point.cpp
```
- Type 'make' or 'make point' to compile
### Dependencies
- Make uses time-stamps to decide whether to rebuild something
	- If the dependency time-stamp is more recent than the product, rebuild the product
	- Do this recursively
		- If a dependency has a rule to be build, check if that needs to rebuild
### More Advanced
- Define compilation properties with variables
```
# use variables to define compilation properties
CC = g++
CFLAGS = -Wall
```
- Define rules for executable and for each source file
	- Only recompiles changed .cpp files
```
point: main.o point.o
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o point main.o point.o
main.o: main.cpp point.h
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c main.cpp
point.o: point.cpp point.h
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c point.cpp
```
- Add a 'clean' rule
	- sometimes you want to make sure everything gets recompiled
```
clean:
	rm -f point *.o
```
- A 'test' rule can be handy
```
test:
	./point > testLog.txt
```
### Reorganizing the code
- Often want include files in one folder and .cpp in another
```
point/
	include/
		opint.h
	src/
		point.cpp main.cpp
```
### Tell Compiler Where Things Are
- Use -I flag to tell compiler to look in that directory for #include things
	- In src need to go up a directory and then down into the include directory to find point.h
	```-I ../include```
	- The full compile line would look like
	```g++ -I ../include -o testPoint main.cpp point.cpp```
- Define INCLUDE variable
	```INCLUDE = ../include```
- Use -I flag to tell compiler to look in that directory for #include things
- Use INCLUDE to point to .h file
```
main.o: main.cpp $(INCLUDE)/point.h
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -I$(INCLUDE) -c main.cpp
```
- The top INCLUDE is a dependency check if the .h has changed. The bottom one is telling the compiler where to look for include files
### Redone Makefile
```
CC = g++
CFLAGS = -Wall
INCLUDE = ../include
point: main.o point.o
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o point main.o point.o
main.o: main.cpp $(INCLUDE)/point.h
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -I$(INCLUDE) -c main.cpp
point.o: point.cpp $(INCLUDE)/point.h
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -I$(INCLUDE) -c point.cpp
clean:
	rm -f point *.o
```
### What to do with all the .o files
- Turn multiple .o files into a library
	- Share code with headers and .a or .so library files
		- .a for static library
		- .so for shared, dynamically-loaded library
- To make a library
	- Archive command 'ar'
	```ar -rcs libpoint.a point.o other.o```
### Using a Static Library
- Assume a variable POINT that is a path to the point folder with an include, src, lib subfolders
- To use this library of provided code
	- When compiling the .cpp into .o files
		- Path to the header files
		```
		main.o: main.cpp $(POINT)/include/point.h
			$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -I$(POINT)/include -c main.cpp
		```
	- When linking the .o and .a into an executable
		- Path to the .a file with -L
		- Name of the .a file with -lname or just libname.a
			- -l adds back in the lib
