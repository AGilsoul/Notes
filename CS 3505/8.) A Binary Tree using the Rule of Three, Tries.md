### Admin
- A3 due tonight
- Quiz 2 end of class
- A2 peer review file submission Friday
- A4 released tomorrow
	- We get a little extra time for that
### Dangling Pointers
- What happens?
```C++
int* valPtr = new int(4);
delete valPtr;
cout << *valPtr << endl;
*valptr = 5; // don't do this!!! we don't own this memory location anymore
```
### Review: The Rule of Three
- When a class manages a resource
	- New memory
	- Open file
- Need an explicit
	- Destructor
	- Copy constructor
	- Assignment operator
- This is because the default versions only copy values from one instance variable to the other, which leads to unexpected sharing of resources
### Assignment Operator
- Copy then swap idiom
	- x=y
	- y copied to other
	- swap x data with with other
	- swap x length with other
	- other destructed when leaving scope
```C++
DArray operator=(DArray other) {
	swap(data_, other.data_);
	swap(len_, other.len_);
	return *this;
}
```
### Strategies for Resource Management
- Resource management is error prone
	- int* vals = new int[4];
	- when does vals get deleted?
- Connect vals resources to object-lifetime stack behavior
	- delete when leaving scope
- Wrap a resource in a stack-object
- This is what DArray is
	- DArray objects can be made on the stack
		- DArray handles the destruction
### Resource Acquisition is Initialization
- This concept is formalized in an idiom
	- RAII
		- Wrap resources in a class
		- Acquire resources in a constructor
		- Release resources in destructor
	- Make resource availability a class invariant
		- No need to make open()/close() methods, logic to check if resource is initialized, etc.
### Data Structures
- What might a binary tree node look like?
```C++
class BT {
	BT* left;
	BT* right;
	string word;
public:
	BT(string text) : left(nullptr), right(nullptr), word(text) {}

	BT(const BT& other) {
		word = other.word;
		left = nullptr;
		right = nullptr;
		if (other.left) {
			left = new BT(*(other.left));
		}
		if (other.right) {
			right = new BT(*(other.right));
		}
	}

	// already existing BT = other BT
	BT& operator=(BT other) {
		std::swap(word, other.word);
		std::swap(left, other.left);
		std::swap(right, other.right);
		return this;
	}

	~BT() {
		cout << "Deleting: " << this << endl;
		delete left; // calls ~BT for left node
		delete right; // calls ~BT for right node
	}

	void addWord(string wordToAdd) {
		if (wordToAdd < word) {
			if (left) {
				left->addWord(wordToAdd);
			}
			else {
				left = new BT(wordToAdd);
			}
		}
		else {
			if (right) {
				right->addWord(wordToAdd);
			}
			else {
				right = new BT(wordToAdd);
			}
		}
	}

	void printTree(string spacing) {
		if (left) {
			left->printTree(spacing + " ");
		}
		cout << spacing << word << endl;
		if (right) {
			right->printTree(spacing + " ");
		}
	}
};

int main() {
	BT root("me");
	root.addWord(...);
	...
	root.addWord(...);
	root.printTree("");
}
```
### C++ Strings
- String object
	- Not just raw memory and pointer
	- ```#include <string>```
	- mutable
- Operations
	- substr: get a portion of the string
	- append: add characters on the end
