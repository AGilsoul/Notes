### A4
- Let's discuss allWords
- You probably have some loop like
```C++
for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
	stuff
	recurse
}
```
- What should be an invariant in the loop
	- The word so far and the current node pointer
- Some debugging advice
	- Keep track of the recursion with node addresses
```C++
for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
	if there is a branch
	cout << "Node: " << this << " index " << i << " word so far " << word << endl;
	recurse
}
```
### A5
- Optional partner assignment
	- Use either person's A4
- Write Googletest unit tests for A4
- Refactor A4 to use a map of nodes instead of a fixed-size array of node pointers
- Improve code style
- Rework structure to be cleaner
- No peer review of A4
- Map
	- Associative container
		- Contains pair<const Key, Value>
	- Data is copied to the container when added
		- map['c'] = created_node;
	- Why did
		- Data member in Node children[26]; cause an infinite loop in A3
		- But data member map<char, Node> doesn't
### Map Assignment and Lookup
- Assign
```C++
users["David"] = 100;
```
- Lookup
```C++
cout << users["David"] << endl;
```
### Dangers of Raw Key Testing
- Might be tempted to try
```C++
if (branch['c'] != nullptr)
```
	- Will assign an empty element to ['c'] if nothing there
- branch.at('c') throws if 'c' not in map
- branch.count('c') 1 for found 0 for not
- C++20 adds branch.contains(key)
	- Compile with -std=c++20
- branch.find('c')
```C++
it = branch.find('c');
if (it != branch.end())
```
### Look at all Pairs
- How can we look at all pairs without a list of keys?
- Iterators
```C++
for (map<string, int>::iterator it = users.begin(); it != users.end(); it++)
	cout << it->first << " " << it->second;
```
### Some Nice Things
- Iterators are big type names
- Use auto
	- Assigns the type automatically
	- Not to make a variable have different types
```C++
for (auto it = users.begin(); it != users.end(); it++)
```
### Range-Based Loops
- Use a loop over a collection
- Loop variable takes on value of each element in collection
```C++
for (auto e : users)
	cout << e.first << ":" << e.second << endl;
```
- How would you use this to modify users?
### Structured Binding
- Iterating over a map can be confusing with templated Pair elements or iterators with the itr->first/second notation
- C++ allows structured binding
```C++
for (auto const& [key, val] : symbolTable)
```
- A structured binding
	- Adds identifier names to the scope
	- Binds the names to elements of an expression
	- Can pull from arrays, tuples, class data members
```C++
int a[2] = {1, 2};
auto [x, y] = a; // creates e[2], copies a into e, then x refers to e[0], y to e[1]
auto& [xr, yr] = a; //xr refers to a[0], yr refers to a[i]
```
### Quiz 3
- Thursday
	- We will move to S BEH AUD at the start of the quiz!
- Topics
	- Rule of 3
	- Issues with lifetime of objects
		- When and where created
		- When and where destructed
	- Topics from A3 and A4
		- Pass by value or reference in recursion
		- Following a path in a tree-like data structure
### Code Style
- What do you think of
```C++
for (int index = values.size(); index--;)
```
### Where Are We?
- We have looked at making classes in isolation
	- Constructors/operators/methods
	- Some common C++ data structures
- Time to look at how classes work together
	- Inheritance
	- Polymorphism
### Relationships Between Objects
- There are two main concepts that express the relationships between objects
	- is-a-kind-of
		- Cat is a kind of Animal
	- has-a
		- Car has an Engine
		- Expressed as "object composition"
```C++
class Car {
	Engine vroomVroomPart;
	Car(int hp) : vroomVroomPart(hp) {}; 
};
```
### Which is Better?
- Traditionally argued that "composition should be preferred over inheritance"
- More natural to build classes out of components than to find commonalities and build a rigid tree of relationships
### Is-A-Kind-Of
- Inheritance is C++'s effort to express is-a-kind-of relationships
- Syntax
```C++
class Cat : public Animal {	
}
```
- Cat is a derived class - Animal the base class
- Cat is a child class - Animal the parent class
- Cat is a subclass - Animal the super class
- What does Cat get from animal?
### What Gets Inherited?
- The derived class gets from the base:
	- All member methods
	- All member variables
- The derived class does not get
	- Any constructors or destructors
	- Static members
	- operator=
	- friend declarations
### Access Modifiers
- We have seen
	- public: members are visible to all
	- private: data members are still there but only accessed through base class code
- New modifier
	- protected: members are visible to class and derived code
### Inheritance Access
- Most common to inherit as public
	- Parent class items exist in child with visibility at most public
- Private inheritance
	- Acts more like a "has-a" or "implemented with" relationship
	- Doesn't expose public parent members
		- Not public through the child class - private in child
		- The child class can still use
### Override Methods
- A derived class can have a method with the same name/return/parameters as the base class
	- An object of the derived class will use the overridden method
		- This "binding" of call and implementation happens at compile-time
	- Pointers to objects can have some subtle effects
		- Method calls are bound to the type of the pointer
### Virtual
- The virtual keyword
	- Asks for late binding during run-time
	- Virtual in base class means virtual in all derived
		- Optional on derived classes
	- Virtual methods allow containers of base class references or pointers to access overridden methods
		- A vector of base pointers <Animal*>
		- Holds pointers to derived Cat*, Dog*
### Dynamic Dispatch
- How does the proper method get found?
- Two ideas
	- Virtual table, or vtable
		- A table of pointers to the methods that object should call
	- Vpointer
		- A pointer added to the class indicating with vtable to use
- A pointer to an object uses the object vpointer to find the vtable
- ![[Pasted image 20240924134612.png]]
### Virtual Destructors
- What would be the behavior of
	- Non-virtual destructor in base class
	- A base class pointer to a derived object
	- Calling delete on the pointer
- The base class destructor would be used
- Need to make base class destructor virtual so derived class destructor gets used
### Abstract Classes
- Contain at least 1 pure virtual function
```C++
virtual void out() = 0;
```
	- No implementation needed
	- Must be implemented in all derived classes
	- Cannot make an object of that class
- A class with only pure virtual methods acts as an interface contract between derived classes
### Opinion
- Classes are cool
	- Make a Vec
	- Allow z = x + y;
- Inheritance can be nice
- But be careful - you shouldn't have to think too hard when programming
### Handling Errors
- How should code handle errors?
	- Want robust code
	- Graceful exits
### Error-Handling
- One way
	- Return value for status
	- Pass-by-ref for data
```C++
int A() {
	if (error) return -1;
} 
int B() {
	int err = A();
	if (err) return -1;
}
int main {
	int err = B();
}
```
- Four issues
	- Error propagation
	- Constructors
	- Readability
	- Returning answers or errors
### Errors in Constructors
- Constructors do not return a value
- How to get errors out?
### Readability
- Error codes intersperse "the good case" with "the bad case"
- Compare to exception-handling mechanisms
### Try-Throw-Catch
- Put the "good case" in the try
- Put the "bad case" in the catch
- The code called in the try can "throw" an exception
	- Execution in the throwing function is interrupted
	- Execution goes to the catch
```C++
int main() {
	try {
		openFile();
		prepareRead();
		readLine():
		convert();
		write();
	}
	catch(...) { // catch all
		if (open())
			closeFile():
	}
}
```
### Catch Options
- Catch all ```catch(...)```
- Integer ```catch(int i)```
- std::exception ```catch(std::exception &e)```
	- has a string what() method
- Any C++ type
- Your own exception class
### Example
```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <exception>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

void A() {
	int *array = new int[100000000000000];
}

int main() {
	try {
		A();
	}
	catch(std::exception &e) {
		cout << "caught " << e.what() << endl; 
	}
}
```
### What Happens After a Throw?
- The call stack is "unwound" while looking for a catch block
	- Local variable destructors are called
	- In a constructor, anything already constructed is destructed
