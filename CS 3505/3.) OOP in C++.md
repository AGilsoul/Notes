### Bad Function Example
```C++
// set the sign flag to 1 for positive, 0 for 0, and -1 for negative
void setSign(int number, int& sign) {
	if (number > 0) sign = 1;
	if (number < 0) sign = -1;
}

// in main
int signFlag = 0;
setSign(number, signFlag);
```
- The contract says that the sign is set, no reason to make it a side-effect instead of just returning the sign
- Related logic should be in an else-if chain
- Assuming the user of your code will do a third of the job for you (making the signFlag variable = 0 initially) does not fulfill the contract
### C++ Classes
Why Object Oriented Programming?
Major Principles
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

Goal of OOP
- Make C++ look like a specialized language for solving the problems you want to solve!
	- Add types (objects) that support this

C-style Struct
- Collect related information into a named type structure
- Declare variables of that type
```C++
struct HealthInfo {
	int id;
	double weight;
	bool rideMotorcycle;
	bool smoke;
	double height;
	int age;
	int exercise;
	int drink;
	bool playVideoGamesAllNight;
};

HealthInfo dj;
```

Access is still an issue!
```C++
HealthInfo dj;
dj.age = -10;
dj.drinks = ?
```

Struct
- Fails abstraction - internal representation has to be known
- Fails encapsulation - internals are exposed

C++ Class Basics
- Keyword class
- Data members (instance variables)
- Member functions - methods
- Constructor
- Make a point class

Class Definition
```C++
class Point {

};
```
- Point becomes a new type to use
```C++
Point myPoint;
```

Data Members
- Make private data members
```C++
private:
	double x, y;
```
- Keyword private: or public: or protected
- Sets access mode until next access keyword. Default start is private
	- Public: accessible to all code
	- Protected: access to class code and derived classes
	- Private: only access from class code
		- Friend code can also access

Constructors
- When you declare an object variable, memory is reserved for the object's data members
- How are they initialized?
	- Primitive data members have no default values
	- Object data members have their default constructor called
	- All of this can be overridden in a constructor
- System automatically makes a default constructor
```C++
Point myPt; // calls default constructor
```
- You can overload the constructor to have different parameters
- If you make your own, then you need to also make the default (if you want it)
```C++
Point() {} // a default constructor
Point() = default; // new C++11 option
```

Custom Constructors
- Should assign values to each data member
```C++
Point (int initx, int inity) {
	x = initx;
	y = inity;
}
```
- Data member x might get default constructed and then initx is assigned to it

Initializer List
- Rather than assign in constructor body
- Can use initializer list
	- Avoids default construction followed by assignment
- Handles case of no default constructor
- Avoids name clash
- Looks mysterious
```C++
Point(int x, int y) : x(x), y(y) { }
// or (in C++11)
Point(int x, int y) : x{x}, y{y} { }
```

Brace-or-Equals Initialization
- Can also provide default initialization for data members directly
	- Two different styles
- private
```C++
	double x = 1.0, y{4};
```
- These get used if not set in initializer list or overridden in the constructor

Accessing Members of a Class
- For an object P1 we can access public members by
	- "dot" notation: P1.x; P1.display();
- For a pointer to an object, P1ptr, we use
	- "arrow" notation: P1ptr->x; P1ptr->display();
- These are legal, but mostly weird
	- (&P1)->x
- Inside class code, the keyword "this" is a pointer to the object that called a method
```C++
	this->x;   // *this is the actual object
```

Class Methods
- Typically fall into a few categories
	- Constructors
	- Setters/getters
	- Operators
	- Normal methods

Setters/Getters
- A religious war topic
- Typical setter/getter
```C++
// Get the value of the private x data member
int getX() {
	return x;
}
// Set the value of the private x data member
void setX(double newx) {
	x = newx;
}
```
- Why is this contentious?

Making Objects: Different than Java
```Java
Point c = new Point(2,3);
```
```C++
Point center(2,3);
```
- Java:
	- Makes a new Point object using a constructor and assigns a reference to c
	- The point goes away when nothing is referencing it
	- Without the new, is just a reference
- C++
	- Never use () for default
		- Just use Point center;
	- If center is a local variable
		- Constructed on stack
	- Deconstructed when leave scope

Overloading Operators
- We want our data types to act like built-in types
```C++
newpt = pt * 2.0;
```
- Overload operators
	- List of operators
	- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operators_in_C_and_C%2B%2B

Model for Overloading
- The compiler transforms the infix notation to a method or function call
```C++
newpt = pt * 2.0;
// becomes
newpt = pt.operator*(2.0);
```
- Once you know that, defining them is easy

An Overloaded *
- One way
```C++
Point operator*(double scaleFactor) {
	Point res;
	res.x = x * scaleFactor;
	res.y = y * scaleFactor;
	return res;
}
```
- Another
```C++
Point res(x * scaleFactor, y * scaleFactor);
return res;
```

New and Delete
- Can dynamically allocate memory
	- New allocates space for object and calls constructor
	- Delete frees up the memory
- Allocation on the heap
	- Fairly expensive operation
```C++
int* p = new int(4);
delete p;
```

Using Pointers
- Given this code
- Write a line to replace the 4 value with the current value plus one
```C++
int* p = new int(4); 
*p = *p + 1;
```

Arrays
- Can dynamically allocate an array
```C++
int *x = new int[10];
x[0] = 5;
```
- Special delete
```C++
delete [] x;
```
- Pointer math - knows underlying size
```C++
x++;
*(x+1);
```
