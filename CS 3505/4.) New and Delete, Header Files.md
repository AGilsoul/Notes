A Reminder of Java
- Declare a variable
```Java
Point center;
```
- These are really reference types
	- No allocation of memory for a Point
- Assign it to an object allocated with new
```Java
center = new Point();
```
- The object is smart and knows how many references use that object
- The object removes itself when no more references
### Declare Variables
Java
```Java
Point center;
```
- Makes a ref waiting to get an object
- If assigned, the ref count goes down when center leaves scope
C++
```C++
Point center;
```
- Allocate memory of a Point using the default constructor
- center is fully usable after this statement
- Object is destructed when center leaves scope
- Instance variables
	- Primitives go away
	- Destructor called on instance variable objects
### New
Java
```Java
Point c = new Point(2,3);
```
- new creates a Point object that deallocates itself when no more references
- new object reference is assigned to implicit reference type
C++
```C++
Point* center = new Point();
```
- new allocates memory for a Point and calls a constructor
	- it returns an address to the memory
	- that address must be stored in a pointer
- Must use a delete on the pointer to free the memory
- Output of new is only assigned to pointers
- Not
	- Point center = new Point();
- Not even to a reference
	- Point& center = new Point();
### Problems with C++ new
- Memory leak
	- For every new called, need a delete
- End of the program cleans up your messes
	- Do not rely on that
```C++
for (unsigned int i = 0; i < 1000000000; i++) {
	int* p = new int(4);
}
```
- Double delete
```C++
int *p = new int(4);
delete p;
delete p;
```
### Make Variable/Memory Table
```C++
void ex(int a, int* b) {
	*b = a;
	// draw table here
}

int main() {
	int c = 1, d = 2;
	ex(c, &d);
}
```

| Name | Type | Address |
| ---- | ---- | ------- |
| c    | int  | 1000    |
| d    | int  | 1004    |
| a    | int  | 1008    |
| b    | int* | 100C    |

| Value  | Stack Address |
| ------ | ------------- |
| 1      | 1000          |
| 2 -> 1 | 1004          |
| 1      | 1008          |
| 1004   | 100C          |
### Overload <<
- Want
```C++
cout << myPoint << endl;
```
	- What does this get transformed into?
- << is evaluated left-to-right
- So cout << myPoint needs to evaluate to a stream so the << endl works.
### Need to be outside friend function
- In class, prototype the friend function
```C++
friend ostream& operator<<(ostream& output, Point pt);
```
- Outside class, make function
```C++
ostream& operator<<(ostream& output, Point pt) {
	output << "(" << pt.x << "," << pt.y << ")";
	return output;
}
```
- & makes a reference to the original stream
- Doesn't need friend if it uses getters to access data members
### Destructors
- Destructors are called when an object leaves scope or delete is called on an object
- Looks like
```C++
~Point() { //stuff }
```
- Destructors are needed when the base class has acquired resources that need to be cleaned up
	- memory
	- open files/network connections/etc.
- Does Point need a destructor? (I'd say no)
### Using Multiple Files
- Most C++ projects are broken into multiple files
	- Often move each class into its own file(s)
		- An implementation in a .cpp file
		- An interface in a header file with a .h extension
	- The header file is #include'd in .cpp files
		- This is a very simple model
		- During compilation, the .h text is (virtually) inserted into the .cpp file at the location of the include
- Break Point.cpp into multiple files
### #include
- #include is an example of a preprocessor directive - it tells the compiler to do something
- Two main ways of including
```#include <systemheader> ```
	- Searches in known locations for systemheader
``` #include "myLocal.h"```
	- Looks in local directory and project specified locations
- Why not systemheader.h?
	- C-style headers are ```<stdio.h>```
	- C++-style lack the .h to be different
		- There is a file called "iostream" on our system 
### Design Rules for .h files
- Definition in Ex.h,
- Use include guards
- No 'using namespace' in .h
- Use minimal includes in the header
```C++
#ifndef EX_H
	#define EX_H  // preprocessor macro, can act like a variable, this just uses the existence

#include <iostream>

class Ex {
	int x;  // data member
public:
	Ex(int x) ;  // constructor (no implementation, just forward declaration)
	Ex(std::ostream);  // no using namespace std
};
```
- Implementation of constructor in Ex.cpp
- The implementation .cpp should not assume the .h will continue to have includes such as iostream
```C++
#include "Ex.h"
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

Ex::Ex(int x) : x(x) { }
```
### Redefinition Issues
- Easy to include a .h more than once
- This will cause a redefinition error of the class or functions or variables
- Use an include guard
	- A conditional preprocessor directive
	- Set a preprocessor variable
```C++ 
A.h
	// some A code
B.h
#include A.h
	// some B code

main.cpp
#include "A.h"
#include "B.h"
```
### Commenting
- Let's start using some basic VSCode comment templates
	- Type '///' in a line above the method/class
	- For the @brief write about what it does
	- For the @param provide a short what it is and any assumptions
	- For the @return the meaning of the result
- For the class
	- A brief general description
### Where Should Comments Go?
- Diversity of opinion
	- In header so users can see interface
	- In .cpp to keep header succinct and comments in code
	- In both
		- Apparently to create an updating nightmare
- For us, try
	- Formal comments in header
	- Comments in .cpp if needed to describe how the code works
	- End of line // comments on data members if unclear from name
### g++ Compilation
- g++ really does two things
	- Compile the source
	- Link the files together
		- If Point(x,y) is defined on Point.cpp, then when main.cpp is compiled it
			- Sees the prototype of Point(x,y) in the .h file
			- Enters that in some internal table
			- When it is used in main.cpp it knows it should exist
			- During linking, it makes the connection between the prototype table and the actual compiled implementation
### Reorganizing the Code
- Often want include files in one folder and .cpp in another
```
point/
	include /
		point.h
	src/
		point.cpp main.cpp
```
### Tell Compiler Where Things Are
- Use ```-I``` flag to tell compiler to look in that directory for ```#include``` things
	- In src need to go up a directory and then down into the include directory to find point.h
		- ```-I ../include```
	- The full compile line would look like
		- ```g++ -I ../include -o testPoint main.cpp point.cpp```
### Assignment 2
- Make a class to generate values from a function
	- Overload some operators
- Split the class into header and implementation files in different directories
- Have a small test program
