### Making an Object
- Some thoughts
	- When you make an instance of a class, what is done automatically?
		- Space for the instance variables is allocated
	- When an instance is destructed, what is done automatically?
		- Space for instance variables is freed
		- What happens with pointers?
	- When you make an instance of a class, where do the instance variables live?
	- It depends
		- If made regularly, on the stack
		- If made with new and a pointer, on the heap
### Testing of Software
- Not just bug finding
	- Assessment of overall fitness relative to the purpose of the software
### Importance of Testing
- Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
- The earlier the better!
	- Cost to fix defects at stages:
		- Requirements: 1x
		- Design: 2x
		- Coding: 5x
		- Testing: 10x
		- Production: 30x
### Types of Testing
- Unit Testing: The testing of individual software components
- Functional/System Testing: Testing based on an analysis of the specification of the functionality of a component or system
- User Acceptance Testing: Formal testing with respect to user needs, requirements, and business processes
- Integration Testing: Testing performed to expose defects in the interfaces and interactions between integrated components or systems
- Performance Testing: The process of testing to determine the performance of a software product
- Load Testing: To evaluate the behavior of a component or system with increasing load, e.g. numbers of parallel users and/or numbers of transactions
### Styles of Testing
- Static
	- Code reviews
	- Compiler tools
- Dynamic
	- Executing code
		- Test cases
	- Testing frameworks
- Open box
	- Tests internal structures of the code
	- Exercise execution paths to uncover problems in all portions of code
	- Requires knowledge of internal structure of code
- Closed box
	- Tests functionality vs. specifications
	- use case testing
	- no code knowledge required
### Designing Tests
- Equivalence Partitioning
	- Group inputs into equivalent groups or partitions
		- Valid partitions - inputs with defined outputs
		- Invalid partitions - inputs with ill-defined outputs
- Example: Return a letter grade
	- A: 90 >= grade <= 100 (Partition 1)
	- B: >= grade < 90 (Partition 2)
	- F: grade < 80 (Partition 3)
- What are the partitions? (>100 partition 4)
### Boundary Value Analysis
- Test values at boundaries of partitions
	- Think of this as edge cases
- Two value boundary
	- Check min and max values of partition
	- Check A score at 90 and 100
- Three value boundary
	- Check before boundary, at boundary, above boundary
	- Check lower A score at 89, 90, 91
### State Transition Testing
- A system might respond differently to the same input based on internal state
	- Can you think of an example with Trie?
	- Add "cat" then "cats"
		- or
	- Add "cats" then "cat"
- The behavior is different based on prior words added
	- The tester needs a model of system states
### Random Testing
- Also called "monkey testing"
- Use random inputs
	- Need to be able to determine a correct result
		- Number of words in the Trie
		- Sometimes called 'property testing' when checking general outcome
- Related to fuzz testing
	- Fuzz testing is often related to crashing the program or looking for security risks
### Look at some C++ Tools
- g++ -Wall
	- enables "all" warnings that come from "questionable code" and are easy to fix
- g++ -pedantic
	- issues warnings based on strict ISO C++
- g++ Wextra
### C++ Language
- Assert
	- in ```<cassert>```
	- void assert(expression)
	- if expression is false
		- write error message
		- abort execution
- Designed to catch programming errors
	- things that should not ever be false
		- ```assert(length >= 0);```
- Help to document program logic and contractual assumptions
### Assert
- Can turn assert off with
	- #define NDEBUG
	- g++ -DNDEBUG
- Why turn them off?
	- put in lots during testing
	- no performance hit in release
### Testing Frameworks
- Different options
	- Cppunit
	- Googletest
- Let's look at Googletest
	- Unit testing
	- Turn informal test programs into more formal process
### Googletest
- Goals
	- Tests should be independent and repeatable
		- Our test programs are not independent of prior execution
	- Tests should be organized
	- Help with administration of tests
### gtest structure
- If you close the git googletest repo (https://github.com/google/googletest.git), cmake . (in googletest)
```
googletest/
	lib/
		libgtest.a
		libgtest_main.a
	googletest/
		include/
			gtest/
				gtest.h
```
### Basic Structure
- Low-level
	- Write assertions
	- ```ASSERT_EQ(x.size(), y.size()) << "Vectors x and y are of unequal length";```
	- Error messages are streamed into the ASSERT
	- Also EXPECT versions which do not terminate
		- ```EXPECT_EQ```
### Types of ASSERTS
```C++
ASSERT_TRUE
ASSERT_FALSE
ASSERT_EQ
ASSERT_NE
ASSERT_LT
ASSERT_LE
ASSERT_GT
ASSERT_GE
FAIL()
ADD_FAILURE()
ASSERT_THROW
```
- Testing expects form of ```ASSERT_*(expected, actual)```, so your function calls go in the "actual" spot
### Create a Test
- TEST defines a 
	- Test case
	- And a test name
	- Put assertions in function body
- Multiple tests per case
```C++
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
	EXPECT_EQ(1, Factorial(0));
}

TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesPositiveInput) {
	EXPECT_EQ(1, Factorial(1));
	EXPECT_EQ(2, Factorial(2));
	EXPECT_EQ(6, Factorial(3));
	EXPECT_EQ(40320, Factorial(8));
}
```
### One Common Problem
- Do not use ```ASSERT/EXPECT_EQ``` on boolean values
- Use ```ASSERT/EXPECT_TRUE/FALSE```
	- ```EXPECT_FALSE(t.isAWord("cat"));```
- Use special versions for double/float
	- The last value is a tolerance to how much they can differ and still be considered equal
	- ```EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ(1.0, val, e-15);```
### Running Tests
- Test code includes "gtest/gtest.h"
	- Let's see what is in gtest.h as well
		- What does this imply for the -I flag?
- main must call
	- InitiGoogleTest and RUN_ALL_TESTS()
- Or, they provide a generic main in a library you can link against
- Compile has -L and -I and links to 
	- ```-lgtest -lgtest_main -lpthread```
- Example
```
g++ -o pointersTest -std=c++2a pointers.0 pointersTest.cpp -L../googletest/lib -I../googletest/googletest/include -lgtest -lgtest_main -lpthread
```
### Refactoring Code
- Most of us are familiar with an IDE refactor
- Kent Beck coined
	- "code smells"
		- A code smell is a surface indication that usually corresponds to a deeper problem in the system
			- Quick to spot
			- Doesn't always mean a problem, but does show more investigation is needed
### Refactoring
- Code refactoring
	- Not just renaming methods!
	- Small changes to code yielding the same functionality
		- Not the kind of thing traditional management was excited about
	- Constant improvement
		- Confusing code => simpler code
	- Lots of small improvement can yield a much better overall design
		- Better design is more reusable/adaptable
### Types of Code Smells
- Let's look at some code smells
```C++
void doesItSmell() {
	int x = 1;
	int y = 2;

	x += 3;
	y += 5;

	cout << "x " << x << endl;
	cout << "y " << y << endl;
}
```
- Blank lines is an extreme version of the Long Method code smell
	- Break lots of lines of code into method calls
	- Each piece can be tested independently
### What Would You Changes?
```C++
// convert to cents
a = x * 100;
// avg cents per customer
// n is not 0 here
avg = a / n;
// add to list
avgs.push_back(avg);
count++; // increment count
```
### Refactor
```C++
cents = dollars * 100.0;

assert(customerCount != 0);
averagePerCustomer = cents / customerCount;

trackAverage(averagePerCustomer);
```
### Describe the Why
- Do not say what is happening
	- ```// add one to count```
- Say why something is done
	- ```// lib HARU has an origin at bottom left of page, so offset to center```
- Javadoc style "what" comments also have a place as the "official" documentation
### Thoughts?
```C++
if (((smellsGood && (isChicken || isSeaFood) && !(price < 10) && !iFeelRandomlyPicky)) || otherCatisEatingIt) {
	cat.eat();
}
```
### Turn into Functions and/or Named Booleans
```C++
if (decideToEAt()) cat.eat();
// or
bool isFoodCatLikes = isChicken || isSeaFood;
bool isHighQuality = smellsGood && !(price < 10);
```
### Opinions?
```C++
if (x == 2) x *= 2;
```
### Avoid Misuse of =, Use Brackets Around All Control Statements
```C++
if (2 == x) {
	x *= 2;
}
```
### Thoughts?
```C++
if (x >= 0)
	for (i = 0; i < num; i++)
		for (j = i; j < sum; j++)
			add = x + i*j;
```
### Guard Clauses and Helper Functions
```C++
if (cash < 0)
	return;
for (int i = 0; i < num; i++)
	add = sumIt(cash, i);
```
### Thoughts?
```C++
double averageAge = 0.0;
double totalSalary = 0.0;
for (auto person: people) {
	averageAge += person.age;
	totalSalary += person.salary;
}
averageAge /= people.size();
```
### Use Split Loop
```C++
double totalSalary = 0.0;
for (auto person: people) {
	totalSalary += person.salary;
}
double averageAge = 0.0;
for (auto person: people) {
	averageAge += person.age;
}
averageAge /= people.size();
```
### Evaluate
```C++
class Course {
	vector<Student> students;
	vector<Student> failingStudents;
public:
	vector<Student> collectFailingStudents();
}
```
### Object Abuse
- The data in the class represents the state of an object
- The failing students are a temporary vector built up by a method and returned. It is not object state
### Thoughts?
```C++
class Account {
	...
	void interest() {
		switch(account_type) {
			case CHECKING:
				balance = balance * 1.01; break;
			case SAVINGS:
				balance = balance * 1.03; break;
			case RETIREMENT:
				balance = balance * marketReturn(); break;
		}	
	}
}
```
### Use Polymorphism
- Tell-Don't-Ask principle
	- Tell an object what needs to be done and let it decide how to do it
	- Use inheritance instead of switch statements
- Adding a new variant doesn't touch old code
### Dead Code
- Why keep code that isn't being used?
- Delete!
