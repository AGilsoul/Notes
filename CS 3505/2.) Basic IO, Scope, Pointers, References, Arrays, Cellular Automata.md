### Basic IO
Programs run from the terminal have
- standard input
- standard output (default to terminal)
- standard error (default to terminal)
These are streams
- a stream is serial access to a sequence of characters
	- file
	- user
	- network
	- strings
IO Streams
- There are predefined streams in C++ that match up with standard in/out/error
	- std::cin
	- std::cout
	- std::cerr
```C++
#include <iostream>

// using namespace std; bad practice, don't bring in everything!
using std::cin;
using std::cout;
using std::endl;

int main() {
	int score;
	if (cin >> score) // if we can get terminal input for score
		cout << "You entered " << score << endl;
	else
		cout << "Not a number" << endl;
}
```
- This is just a very simple and error prone way to do IO in C++
- Another way is to read a line, convert to stringstream, and extract based on that
- Programs can insert characters onto those streams or extract from them
	- cout << "Hello";
	- cin >> anIntegerVariable;
- << is the insertion operator
- >> is the extraction operator
- These can be overloaded for our own classes
### Scope of Variables
Variables only exist in their enclosing {}
- parameters are considered part of the function body scope
Duplicate names are resolved through most local scope
- Note that not just instance variable shadowing is allowed
### Global Scope
We can make variables in global scope
- There is no class
The variable has scope in the file ("compilation unit")
- There are ways to make it visible to other files with "extern"
- We typically don't need global variables
	- Some use as static const values but often better to wrap in a class
### Function Calling
Functions in C++ use a pass-by-value mechanism by default
```C++
int A(int param1) {
	param1 = 2;
	return param1;
}

int main() {
	int mVar = 1;
	int result = A(mVar);
	return 0;
}
```
Changes to value stored in param1 in A() are not propagated back to the argument in mVar
### Looking at Addresses
```C++
void change(int* valuePtr) {
	*valuePtr = *valuePtr * 2;  // use dereference operator (*) to store something at address specified by pointer, and also get value stored at address
}

int main() {
	int score = 1;
	int* scorePtr = &score;  // stores the address of score
	change(scorePtr);
}
```
Representation in the computer:
- int var = 5;
- int* varA = &var;
- Computer stores var (5) of type int at a given address on the stack at address 1000 (for example)
- Computer stores varA (1000) of type int* at a given address on the stack (next spot after var, 1004, because it was made next)
One Use
 - Pointers an be used to make arguments mutable
### C++ References
References are a safer way to "point" at another object
- Use in parameter list
- Don't change calling syntax
This is the "best" way to make function arguments mutable
If you don't need a null option, use a reference
Use a pointer if needed to interact with legacy code
```C++
int A(int& v) {
	v++;
}

int main() {
	int x = 4;
	A(x);  // changes local x! 
}
```
### Primitive Arrays
A C-style array is 
```C++
int values[10];
```
This lives on the stack
- This is a big difference from Java
- We will discuss this a lot more with objects
- The memory is free when the array leaves scope
	- We did not new or delete it
Declaring an array does not initialize it
```C++
int values[10];  // UB!
```
Using an out-of-bounds index is undefined behavior (UB)
```C++
int value = values[10]; // UB!
```
Array Initialization
- Can provide values
```C++ 
int values [3] {1, 2, 3}; // [1,2,3]
```
- Can provide no values but say it should be default initialized (with 0)
```C++
int values[3] {}; // [0,0,0]
```
- Can provide some values and default initialize the rest to 0
```C++
int values[3] {1}; // [1,0,0]
```
- Can infer the size
```C++
int values[] {1, 2, 3}; // [1,2,3]
```
Array as Pointer
- The array variable really holds a pointer to the first element
	- The size of the array is hidden in some extra allocated memory
- This is valid (but not very good)
```C++
int vals[3] {1, 2, 3};
int* values = vals;
cout << values[1] << endl;
```
Array as Parameter
- We can pass arrays as parameters
	- It is really only a pointer to the start of the array being passed
	- Th internals of the array can be changed and the change persists after the function returns
		- The array pointer is passed-by-value and unchanged
```C++
1. void getVals(int values[3]) { // not a copy }
2. void getVals(int values[]) { // not a copy }
3. void getVals(int* values) { // not a copy }
```
That 3 is a "magic number". Often the size would be passed as a parameter in 2+3. In 1, it could be a global const value.
